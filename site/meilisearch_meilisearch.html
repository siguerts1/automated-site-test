> [!WARNING]
> Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports[#new]]((https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new)/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.14 exposes a more granular way to express your filterable attributes! üéâ This release also improves semantic search performance, embedding indexing speed, and a new route to get multiple documents by IDs.

# New features and updates üî•

## Granular Filterable Attribute Settings

This feature allows for the choice of the filter features of each filterable attribute with high granularity.
Activating or deactivating a feature will have an impact on the indexing time.
To use the feature, use the new `filterableAttributes` format in the settings route (`PATCH /indexes/INDEX_UID/settings`):

```json
{
	"filterableAttributes": [
	  {
	    "attributePatterns": ["genre", "artist"], 
	    "features": { "facetSearch": true, "filter": { "equality": true, "comparison": false } }
	  },
	  {
	    "attributePatterns": ["rank"],
	    "features": { "facetSearch": false, "filter": { "equality": true, "comparison": true } }
	  },
	  {
	    "attributePatterns": ["albumId"],
	    "features": { "facetSearch": false, "filter": { "equality": true, "comparison": false } }
	  },
	]
}
```

> üóíÔ∏è  In this example, we activate/deactivate each feature depending on the usage of each filterable attribute, the `genre` and `artist` are expected to be strings so the facet search and the equality operators (`=`/`!=`) are activated, but, the comparison operators are deactivated (`>=`, `<=`, ...) because it's not useful and will save time during the indexing process.
> However, the rank is expected to be a number, so the facet search is deactivated in favor of the the comparison operators.
> Last, the albumId is expected to be unique, so only the equality operators (`=`/`!=`) are activated.

For more details about this feature, please refer to its [public usage page](https://meilisearch.notion.site/API-usage-Settings-to-opt-out-indexing-features-filterableAttributes-1764b06b651f80aba8bdf359b2df3ca8).

Done by @ManyTheFish in [#5254](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5254).

## Composite Embedders

This feature allows using different embedders at search and indexing time, which is useful to optimize the embedder to each situation:

- Using a remote embedder for indexing in bulk, as remote embedders provide the highest bandwidth (embeddings/s)
- Using a local embedder for answering search queries, as local embedders provide the lowest latency (time to first embedding)

To use the feature, follow these steps:

1. Enable the `Composite embedders` feature from the Cloud dashboard or with the following:
```
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' MEILISEARCH_URL/experimental-features -d '{ "compositeEmbedders": true }'
```
2. Send a settings task (`PATCH /indexes/INDEX_UID/settings`) containing an embedder with `source: "composite"`, and with the parameters `searchEmbedder` and `indexingEmbedder` describing the embedder at search time (resp. indexing time). For example, using a [Hugging Face inference endpoint](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated).
```jsonc
{
    "embedders": {
        "text": {
            "source": "composite",
            "searchEmbedder": {
                "source": "huggingFace", // locally computed embeddings using a model from the Hugging Face Hub
                "model": "baai/bge-base-en-v1.5",
                "revision": "a5beb1e3e68b9ab74eb54cfd186867f64f240e1a"
            },
            "indexingEmbedder": {
                "source": "rest", // remotely computed embeddings using Hugging Face inference endpoints
                "url": "https://URL.endpoints.huggingface.cloud",
                "apiKey": "hf_XXXXXXX",
                "documentTemplate": "Your {{doc.template}}",
                "request": {
                    "inputs": [
                        "{{text}}",
                        "{{..}}"
                    ]
                },
                "response": [
                    "{{embedding}}",
                    "{{..}}"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```
3. Send documents to the index. They will be indexed remotely using the Hugging Face inference endpoint.
4. Perform semantic search queries, they will be embedded using the local model fetched from the Hugging Face Hub.

      <h2>v1.13.0 üïäÔ∏è (2025-02-17)</h2>
      <pre>Meilisearch v1.13 stabilizes AI-powered search integration! üéâ This release also introduces two new experimental features: upgrading to new Meilisearch releases without generating a dump and making federated requests across multiple Meilisearch instances.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment takes 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

<!-- The following lines should NOT be put in the PRE-release changelogs -->
Some SDKs might not include all new features. Consult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and updates üî•

## AI-powered search and vector store stabilization

With v1.13, AI-powered search is available to all users by default and no longer requires manual activation.

### Breaking Changes

* `vectorStore` is no longer an accepted value for the `/experimental-features` route
* Ollama URLs must end with either `/api/embed` or `/api/embeddings`
* Modified error codes:
  - `invalid_embedder` has been split into `invalid_search_embedder` and `invalid_similar_embedder`. These codes are returned when the `embedder` parameter of a request to `/search`, `/multi-search` or `/similar` specifies a non-existing embedder or is not a string
  - `invalid_hybrid_query` has been renamed to `invalid_search_hybrid_query`. It is returned when the `hybrid` parameter contains unknown keys or is not either `null` or an object

Done by @dureuill in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5232 & https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5234

## Experimental feature: Dumpless upgrades

Use `--experimental-dumpless-upgrade` after updating the Meilisearch binary to migrate to a new release:

```sh
./meilisearch --experimental-dumpless-upgrade
```

This faster and more efficient process does not require you to generate a dump and pass it to Meilisearch when upgrading to a new release.

> [!WARNING]
> Meilisearch strongly recommends you generate a backup snapshot before migrating. This is an experimental feature, and failed upgrades may lead to database corruption.

Read more about it [on the dedicated product discussion](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/discussions/804).

Done by @irevoire and @dureuill in https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/5264

## Experimental feature: Remote federated search requests

Use remote federated search requests together with the `/multi-search` route to query multiple Meilisearch instances simultaneously. This is particularly useful when handling very large databases.

First, use the `/experimental-features` route to enable `network`:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "network": true
  }'
```

Next, set up your network of Meilisearch instances with a call to `PATCH /network` configuring one `self` and multiple `remotes`:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/network/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "remotes": {
      "ms-0": {
        "url": "http://ms-1235.example.meilisearch.io",
        "searchApiKey": "Ecd1SDDi4pqdJD6qYLxD3y7VZAEb4d9j6LJgt4d6xas"
      },
      "ms-1": {
        "url": "http://ms-4242.example.meilisearch.io",
        "searchApiKey": "hrVu-OMcjPGElK7692K7bwriBoGyHXTMvB5NmZkMKqQ"
      }
    },
    "self": "ms-0"
  }'
```
Repeat this process with every instance in your network, then add documents. Do not send the same documents to different instances.
Finally, make a `/multi-search` query with the new `federationOptions.remote`:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'MEILISEARCH_URL/multi-search/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "federation": {},
    "queries": [
        {
            "q": "Batman returns dark",
            "indexUid": "movies",
            "federationOptions": {
                "remote": "ms-0"
            }
        },
        {
            "q": "Batman returns dark",
            "indexUid": "movies",
            "federationOptions": {
                "remote": "ms-1"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.13 introduces several significant improvements, including stabilizing the Vector Store feature for seamless hybrid search integration! üéâ This version also simplifies the Meilisearch upgrade process: you don't need a dump for migrating anymore!

# New features and updates üî•

## Stabilize Vector Store feature

After its initial release in v1.3.0, we have now fully stabilized the Vector Store feature. The experimental feature no longer requires manual activation, and the `vectorStore` field is no longer displayed or accepted by the `/experimental-features` route. This makes it even simpler to utilize our hybrid search capability, which delivers significantly better search relevance by combining traditional full text search with AI-powered semantic search.

### Breaking Changes before Stabilization

* Accepted Ollama URLs can only end with `/api/embed` and `/api/embeddings`.
* Modified error codes:
  - `invalid_embedder` has been split into `invalid_search_embedder` and `invalid_similar_embedder`. These codes are returned when the `embedder` parameter of a search (resp. similar) request refers to a non-existing embedder configuration or is not a string.
  - `invalid_hybrid_query` has been renamed to `invalid_search_hybrid_query`. It is returned when the `hybrid` parameter is invalid: contains unknown keys or is not either `null` or an object.

## Experimental Dumpless Upgrade: Ease upgrading to the next version without a dump

From now on you can upgrade any database in the v1.12 version or more to the latest version without using a dump.
That means it's an in-place, way faster upgrade process that consumes only the minimal amount of RAM or disk required.

To upgrade your v1.12 database to v1.13 runs:
```
./meilisearch --experimental-dumpless-upgrade
```

Read more about it [here](https://github.com/orgs/meilisearch/discussions/804).

      <h2>v1.12.0 ü¶ó (2024-12-23)</h2>
      <pre>Meilisearch v1.12 introduces significant indexing speed improvements, almost halving the time required to index large datasets. This release also introduces new settings to customize and potentially further increase indexing speed.

üß∞ All official Meilisearch integrations (including SDKs, clients, and other tools) are compatible with this Meilisearch release. Integration deployment happens between 4 to 48 hours after a new version becomes available.

Some SDKs might not include all new features. Consult the project repository for detailed information. Is a feature you need missing from your chosen SDK? Create an issue letting us know you need it, or, for open-source karma points, open a PR implementing it (we'll love you for that ‚ù§Ô∏è).

# New features and updates üî•

## Improve indexing speed

Indexing time is improved across the board!

- Performance is maintained or better on smaller machines
- On bigger machines with multiple cores and good IO, Meilisearch v1.12 is much faster than Meilisearch v1.11
    - More than twice as fast for raw document insertion tasks.
    - More than x4 as fast for incrementally updating documents in a large database.
    - Embeddings generation was also improved up to x1.5 for some workloads.
    
The new indexer also makes task cancellation faster.

Done by @dureuill, @ManyTheFish, and @Kerollmops in #4900.

## New index settings: use `facetSearch` and `prefixSearch` to improve indexing speed

v1.12 introduces two new index settings: `facetSearch` and `prefixSearch`.

Both settings allow you to skip parts of the indexing process. This leads to significant improvements to indexing speed, but may negatively impact search experience in some use cases.

Done by @ManyTheFish in #5091

### `facetSearch`

Use this setting to toggle [facet search](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/filtering_and_sorting/search_with_facet_filters#searching-facet-values):

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/books/settings/facet-search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary 'true'
```

The default value for `facetSearch` is `true`. When set to `false`, this setting disables facet search for all filterable attributes in an index.

### `prefixSearch`

Use this setting to configure the ability to [search a word by prefix](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/learn/engine/prefix) on an index:

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/books/settings/prefix-search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary 'disabled'
```

`prefixSearch` accepts one of the following values:

- `"indexingTime"`: enables prefix processing during indexing. This is the default Meilisearch behavior
- `"disabled"`: deactivates prefix search completely


Disabling prefix search means the query `he` will no longer match the word `hello`. This may significantly impact search result relevancy, but speeds up the indexing process.

## New API route: `/batches`

The new `/batches` endpoint allow you to query information about task batches.

`GET` `/batches` returns a list of batch objects:

```sh
curl  -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/batches'
```

This endpoint accepts the same parameters as `GET` `/tasks` route, allowing you to narrow down which batches you want to see. Parameters used with `GET` `/batches` apply to the tasks, not the batches themselves. For example, `GET /batches?uid=0` returns batches containing tasks with a `taskUid` of `0` , not batches with a `batchUid` of `0`.

You may also query `GET` `/batches/:uid` to retrieve information about a single batch object:

```sh
curl  -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/batches/BATCH_UID'
```

`/batches/:uid` does not accept any parameters.

Batch objects contain the following fields:

```json5
{
  "uid": 160,
  "progress": {
    "steps": [
      {
        "currentStep": "processing tasks",
        "finished": 0,
        "total": 2
      },
      {
        "currentStep": "indexing",
        "finished": 2,
        "total": 3
      },
      {
        "currentStep": "extracting words",
        "finished": 3,
        "total": 13
      },
      {
        "currentStep": "document",
        "finished": 12300,
        "total": 19546
      }
    ],
    "percentage": 37.986263
  },
  "details": {
    "receivedDocuments": 19547,
    "indexedDocuments": null
  },
  "stats": {
    "totalNbTasks": 1,
    "status": {
      "processing": 1
    },
    "types": {
      "documentAdditionOrUpdate": 1
    },
    "indexUids": {
      "mieli": 1
    }
  },
  "duration": null,
  "startedAt": "2024-12-12T09:44:34.124726733Z",
  "finishedAt": null
}
```

Additionally, task objects now include a new field, `batchUid`. Use this field together with `/batches/:uid` to retrieve data on a specific batch.

```json5
{
  "uid": 154,
  "batchUid": 142,
  "indexUid": "movies_test2",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "type": "documentAdditionOrUpdate",
  "canceledBy": null,
  "details": {
    "receivedDocuments": 1,
    "indexedDocuments": 1
  },
  "error": null,
  "duration": "PT0.027766819S",
  "enqueuedAt": "2024-12-02T14:07:34.974430765Z",
  "startedAt": "2024-12-02T14:07:34.99021667Z",
  "finishedAt": "2024-12-02T14:07:35.017983489Z"
}
```

      <pre>> [!WARNING]
> Since this is a release candidate (RC), we do NOT recommend using it in a production environment. Is something not working as expected? We welcome [bug reports](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/new/choose) and [feedback about new features](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions).

Meilisearch v1.12 introduces huge improvements regarding indexing speed. The team worked hard to divise time to import huge datasets by two. You can also customize your settings to adapt your indexing needs and so, the indexing speed that fits your usage.

# New features and updates üî•

## Improve indexing speed

Indexing time for huge dataset import (multiple millions of documents) is divided by two!

Done by @dureuill, @ManyTheFish, and @Kerollmops in #4900.

## More visibility around indexing tasks

In order to give more visibility around indexing processing around your `task`, especially when indexing big documents, new routes have been introduced:
- `GET /batches/:uid`: returns a specific `batch` object
- `GET /batches`: return a list of `batch` objects

The same query parameters than `GET /tasks` route can be used to apply filtering.

Also, a new field is introduced in the task object: `batch`.

Done by @irevoire in #5060, #5070, #5080

## Other improvements

* Introduce the `reverse` query parameter for `GET‚ÄØ/tasks` route set to `false` by default. If set to `true`, then the tasks will be returned in reversed order (the oldest first). Done by @irevoire in #5048.
* Make matches consider phrases as a single `Match` by @flevi29 in #4928
* Adds new metrics to prometheus by @PedroTurik in #5044
* Add `indices` field to `_matchesPosition` to specify where in an array a match comes from, by @LukasKalbertodt in #5005

# Fixes üêû

* Return an appropriate error when primary keys is greater than 512 bytes, by @flevi29 in #4930

# Misc

* Dependencies updates
  * Update benchmarks to match the new crates subfolder by @Kerollmops in #5021
  * Fix the benchmarks by @irevoire in #5037
  * Bump Swatinem/rust-cache from 2.7.1 to 2.7.5 in #5030
* CIs and tests
  * Improve performance of `delete_index.rs` by @DerTimonius in #4963
  * Improve performance of `create_index.rs` by @DerTimonius in #4962
  * Improve performance of `get_documents.rs` by @PedroTurik in #5025
  * Improve performance of `formatted.rs` by @PedroTurik in #5043
  * Fix the path used in the flaky tests CI by @Kerollmops in #5049
* Misc
  * Rollback the Meilisearch Kawaii logo by @Kerollmops in #5017
  * Add image source label to Dockerfile by @wuast94 in #4990
  * Hide code complexity into a subfolder by @Kerollmops in #5016
  * Internal tool: implement offline upgrade from v1.10 to v1.11 by @irevoire in #5034
