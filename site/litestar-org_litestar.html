      <pre>## Summary

We are pleased to publish our first release of 2025!

Since our last release in November, everyone's been busy.  In that short time, we've managed to squeeze in a huge amount of fixes, features, and (most, importantly) Python 3.13 support.  Thank you to everyone in the community who contributed to this.

As we move towards 3.0, you'll see a few deprecations being added to packages.  Please don't hesitate to join our discord to discuss any deprecation specifics or any other change you'd like to see in 3.0
