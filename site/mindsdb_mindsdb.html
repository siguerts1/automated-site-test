**Features and Enhancements:** 
A custom vllm embedding class has been added for langchain_embedding_handler. Support has been provided for Nomic embedding text formatting. In addition, chatbot creation and updates can now utilize database names via API. A feature for smart release notes has been implemented.

**Bug Fixes and Improvements:** 
Installation error related to httpfs in Amazon S3 integration has been fixed. The redshift handler issue has been resolved. Typos in the README file have been amended. A situation where Vector Database Tables were being dropped while deleting the Knowledge Base has been addressed.

**Other Notable Changes:** 
The Redirect URI has been improved for executing the MS Authentication flow. The class has been improved and now permits logging to files. It is now possible to see types in the information schema. There is now feature to enable copy storage while creating databases via the API.
