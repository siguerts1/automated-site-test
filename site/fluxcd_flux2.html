> [ControlPlane](https://control-plane.io/enterprise-for-flux-cd/) that provide enterprise support for Flux.

### OpenShift compatibility

Flux can be installed on Red Hat OpenShift cluster directly from OperatorHub using
[Flux Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/flux-operator).
The operator allows the configuration of Flux multi-tenancy lockdown, network policies,
persistent storage, sharding, vertical scaling and the synchronization
of the cluster state from Git repositories, OCI artifacts and S3-compatible storage.

## Upgrade procedure

Upgrade Flux from `v2.4.0` to `v2.5.0` by following the [upgrade guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/upgrade/).

There are no new API versions in this release, so no changes are required in the YAML manifests containing Flux resources.

      <h2>v2.4.0 (2024-09-30)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

Flux v2.4.0 is a feature release. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

For a comprehensive overview of new features and API changes included in this release, please refer to the [Announcing Flux 2.4 GA blog post](https://fluxcd.io/blog/2024/09/flux-v2.4.0/).

This release marks the General Availability (GA) of Flux Bucket API. The `Bucket` v1 API comes with new features including: proxy support, mTLS and custom STS configuration for AWS S3 and MinIO LDAP authentication.

The `GitRepository` v1 API gains support for OIDC authentication. Starting with this version, you can authenticate against Azure DevOps repositories using AKS Workload Identity.

The `OCIRepository` v1beta2 API gains support for proxy configuration thus allowing dedicated HTTP/S Proxy authentication on multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters.

The `HelmRelease` v2 API gains support for disabling JSON schema validation of the Helm release values during installation and upgrade. And allows adopting existing Kubernetes resources during Helm release installation.

The Flux controllers are now built with Go 1.23 and their dependencies have been updated to Kubernetes 1.31, Helm 3.16, SOPS 3.9 Cosign 2.4 and Notation 1.2.

❤️ Big thanks to all the Flux contributors that helped us with this release!

### Kubernetes compatibility

This release is compatible with the following Kubernetes versions:

| Kubernetes version | Minimum required |
|--------------------|------------------|
| `v1.29`            | `>= 1.29.0`      |
| `v1.30`            | `>= 1.30.0`      |
| `v1.31`            | `>= 1.31.0`      |

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the Flux project offers support only for the latest three minor versions of Kubernetes.
> Backwards compatibility with older versions of Kubernetes and OpenShift is offered by vendors such as
> [ControlPlane](https://control-plane.io/enterprise-for-flux-cd/) that provide enterprise support for Flux.

### OpenShift compatibility

Flux can be installed on Red Hat OpenShift cluster directly from OperatorHub using [Flux Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/flux-operator). 
The operator allows the configuration of Flux multi-tenancy lockdown, network policies, persistent storage, sharding, vertical scaling and the synchronization of the cluster state from Git repositories, OCI artifacts and S3-compatible storage.

## API changes

### Bucket v1

The [Bucket](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/) kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA).

The v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2.

New fields:

- `.spec.proxySecretRef` allows configuring HTTP/S Proxy authentication for the S3-compatible storage service.
- `.spec.certSecretRef` allows custom TLS client certificate and CA for secure communication with the S3-compatible storage service.
- `.spec.sts` allows custom STS configuration for AWS S3 and MinIO LDAP authentication.

### GitRepository v1

The [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositoies/) kind gains new optional fields with no breaking changes.

New fields:

- `.spec.provider` allows specifying an OIDC provider used for authentication purposes. Currently, only the `azure` provider is supported.

### OCIRepository v1beta2

The [OCIRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositoies/) kind gains new optional fields with no breaking changes.

New fields:

- `.spec.proxySecretRef` allows configuring HTTP/S Proxy authentication for the container registry service.

### HelmRelease v2

The [HelmRelease](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/helm/helmreleases/) kind gains new optional fields with no breaking changes.

New fields:

- `.spec.install.disableSchemaValidation` allows  disabling the JSON schema validation of the Helm release values during installation.
- `.spec.upgrade.disableSchemaValidation` allows  disabling the JSON schema validation of the Helm release values during upgrade.

## Upgrade procedure

Upgrade Flux from `v2.3.0` to `v2.4.0` either by [rerunning bootstrap](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap-upgrade) or by using the [Flux GitHub Action](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/action).

To upgrade the APIs, make sure the new CRDs and controllers are deployed, and then change the manifests in Git:

1. Set  `apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain `Bucket` definitions.
2. Commit, push and reconcile the API version changes.

Bumping the APIs version in manifests can be done gradually.
It is advised to not delay this procedure as the deprecated versions will be removed after 6 months.

Flux v2.2.3 is a patch release which comes with various fixes and improvements. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

:bulb: For upgrading to Flux v2.2, please see [the procedure documented in 2.2.0](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.2.0).

This release updates the Kubernetes dependencies to v1.28.6 and various other dependencies to their latest version to patch upstream CVEs.

All controllers are built with Go 1.21.6 using Alpine Linux 3.19.1 base image.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to breaking changes in [Helm v3.14.0](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.14.0), the helm-controller version included in this patch release comes with Helm SDK v3.13.3.
> A preview build of the helm-controller with the latest Helm SDK is available at [helm-controller#879](https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller/pull/879).

Fixes:

- Reconciling empty directories and directories without Kubernetes manifests no longer results in an error. This regressing bug was introduced with the kustomize-controller upgrade to Kustomize v5.3 and has been fixed in this patch release.
- The regression due to which `Roles` and `ClusterRoles` with aggregated roles were continuous reconciled by kustomize-controller has been fixed.
- Fix the Git revision displaying when notification-controller sends alerts to Grafana.
- The HelmRelease status reporting has been improved by ensuring that the stale failure conditions get updated after failure recovery.

See the components changelog for a full list of bug fixes.

      <h2>v2.2.0 (2023-12-12)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

Flux v2.2.0 is a feature release. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

The Flux CLI and controllers have been updated to Kustomize v5.3.0 and Kubernetes v1.28.4.

Flux helm-controller's reconciliation model underwent a significant overhaul, addressing persistent issues such as the automatic recovery of releases stuck in a pending state. In addition, it improves the observability of the release status, and it introduces the ability to enable drift detection on a per-object basis. For more details on the helm-controller improvements, please see the [Announcing Flux 2.2 GA blog post](https://fluxcd.io/blog/2023/12/flux-v2.2.0/).

The Flux CLI can now be used to force or reset the reconciliation state of a `HelmRelease` v2beta2 object using `flux reconcile hr --force` and `flux reconcile hr --reset`.

Flux CLI comes with support for bootstrapping [Gitea](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/gitea/) repositories and adds guardrails to `flux install` and `flux bootstrap` to protect users from destructive operations. The `flux version` and `flux check` commands now print the Flux distribution version deployed on the cluster.

The Flux alerting capabilities have been extended with [NATS](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/provider/#nats) and [Bitbucket Server & Data Center](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/provider/#bitbucket-serverdata-center) support.

Starting with this release, Flux minor versions are benchmark to measure the Mean Time To Production (MTTP). The results for this version can be found at
[github.com/fluxcd/flux-benchmark](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux-benchmark/blob/main/RESULTS.md#flux-v220).

:heart: Big thanks to all the Flux contributors that helped us with this release!

### Kubernetes compatibility

This release is compatible with the following Kubernetes versions:

| Kubernetes version | Minimum required |
|--------------------|------------------|
| `v1.26`            | `>= 1.26.0`      |
| `v1.27`            | `>= 1.27.1`      |
| `v1.28`            | `>= 1.28.0`      |

Note that Flux may work on older versions of Kubernetes e.g. 1.25, but we don't recommend running end-of-life versions in production nor do we offer support for these versions.

## API changes

### HelmRelease v2beta2

The [HelmRelease](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/helm/helmreleases/) kind was promoted from v2beta1 to v2beta2.

The v2beta2 API is backwards compatible with v2beta1, the v2beta1 API is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Deprecated fields:

- The `.patchesStrategicMerge` and `.patchesJson6902` Kustomize post-rendering fields have been deprecated in favor of `.patches`.
- The `.status.lastAppliedRevision` and `.status.lastReleaseRevision` fields have been deprecated in favor of `.status.history`.
- The `.status.lastAttemptedValuesChecksum` has been deprecated in favor of `.status.lastAttemptedConfigDigest`.

New fields:

- Drift detection and correction is now enabled on a per-release basis using the `.spec.driftDetection.mode` field.
- Ignoring specific fields during drift detection and correction is now supported using the `.spec.driftDetection.ignore`
- Helm tests can now be selectively run using the `.spec.test.filters` field.
- A history of metadata from Helm releases up to the previous successful release is now available in the `.status.history` field. This includes any Helm test results when enabled.
- The `.status.lastHandledForceAt` and `.status.lastHandledResetAt` fields have been introduced to track the last time a force upgrade or reset was handled.

### Alert and Provider v1beta3

The [Alert](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/alerts/) and [Provider](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/providers/) kinds were promoted from v1beta2 to v1beta3.

The v1beta3 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, the `.status` field was removed making the resources static objects. Any errors encountered while sending notifications are now recorded as Kubernetes Events associated with the Alert objects.

### Bucket v1beta2

A new field, `.spec.prefix`, has been added to the [Bucket](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/) API, which enables server-side filtering of files if the object's `.spec.provider` is set to `generic`, `aws` or `gcp`.

### OCIRepository and HelmChart v1beta2

Two new fields, `.spec.verify.matchOIDCIdentity.issuer` and `.spec.verify.matchOIDCIdentity.subject` have been added to the [HelmChart](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmcharts/) and [OCIRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositories/) APIs. If the image has been keylessly signed via Cosign, these fields can be used to verify the OIDC issuer of the Fulcio certificate and the
OIDC identity's subject respectively.

### HelmRepository and ImageRepository v1beta2

A new boolean field, `.spec.insecure`, has been introduced to the
[HelmRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmrepositories/) and [ImageRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/image/imagerepositories/) APIs, which allows connecting to a non-TLS HTTP container registry. For HelmRepositories it is only considered if the object's `.spec.type` is set to `oci`.

From this release onwards, HelmRepository objects of type OCI are treated as static objects, i.e. they have an empty status.

## Upgrade procedure

Upgrade Flux from `v2.x` to `v2.2.0` either by [rerunning bootstrap](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap-upgrade) or by using the [Flux GitHub Action](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/action).

To upgrade the APIs, make sure the new CRDs and controllers are deployed, and then change the manifests in Git:

1. Set  `apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta2` in the YAML files that contain `HelmRelease` definitions.
2. Set  `apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta3` in the YAML files that contain `Alert` and `Provider` definitions.
3. Commit, push and reconcile the API version changes.

Bumping the APIs version in manifests can be done gradually. It is advised to not delay this procedure as the deprecated versions will be removed after 6 months.

      <h2>v2.1.0 (2023-08-24)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

Flux v2.1.0 is a feature release. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

The [Flux APIs](#api-changes) were extended with new opt-in features in a backwards-compatible manner.

The Flux Git capabilities have been improved with support for Git push options, Git refspec, Gerrit, HTTP/S and SOCKS5 proxies.

The Flux alerting capabilities have been extended with [Datadog](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/provider/#pagerduity) support.

The Flux controllers come with performance improvements when reconciling Helm repositories with large indexes (80% memory reduction), and when reconciling Flux Kustomizations with thousands of resources (x4 faster server-side apply). The load distribution has been improved when reconciling Flux objects in parallel to reduce CPU and memory spikes.

:heart: Big thanks to all the Flux contributors that helped us with this release!

## Deprecations

Flux v2.1.0 comes with support for Kubernetes TLS Secrets when referring to secrets containing TLS certs, and deprecates the usage of `caFile`, `keyFile` and `certFile` keys.

For more details about the TLS changes please see the [Kubernetes TLS Secrets section](#kubernetes-tls-secrets).

Flux v2.1.0 comes with major improvements to the Prometheus monitoring stack. Starting with this version, Flux is leveraging the `kube-state-metrics` CRD exporter to report metrics containing rich information about Flux reconciliation status e.g. Git revision, Helm chart version, OCI artifacts digests, etc. The `gotk_reconcile_condition` metrics was deprecated in favor of the `gotk_resource_info`.

For more details about the new monitoring stack please see the [Flux Prometheus metrics documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/monitoring/metrics) and the [flux2-monitoring-example repository](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-monitoring-example).

## <a name="api-changes"></a>API changes

### GitRepository v1

The [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/) API was extended with the following fields:

- `.spec.proxySecretRef.name` is an optional field used to specify the name of a Kubernetes Secret that contains the HTTP/S or SOCKS5 proxy settings.
- `.spec.verify.mode` now support one of the following values `HEAD`, `Tag`, `TagAndHEAD`.

### Kustomization v1

The [Kustomization](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/) API was extended with two apply policies `IfNotPresent` and `Ignore`.

Changing the apply behaviour for specific Kubernetes resources, can be done using the following annotations:

| Annotation                          | Default    | Values                                                         | Role            |
|-------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/ssa`   | `Override` | - `Override`<br/>- `Merge`<br/>- `IfNotPresent`<br/>- `Ignore` | Apply policy    |
| `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force` | `Disabled` | - `Enabled`<br/>- `Disabled`                                   | Recreate policy |
| `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/prune` | `Enabled`  | - `Enabled`<br/>- `Disabled`                                   | Delete policy   |

The `IfNotPresent` policy instructs the controller to only apply the Kubernetes resources if they are not present on the cluster.
This policy can be used for Kubernetes `Secrets` and `ValidatingWebhookConfigurations` managed by cert-manager,
where Flux creates the resources with fields that are later on mutated by other controllers.

### ImageUpdateAutomation v1beta1

The [ImageUpdateAutomation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/image/imageupdateautomations/) was extended with the following fields:

- `.spec.git.push.refspec` is an optional field used to specify a Git refspec used when pushing commits upstream.
- `.spec.git.push.options` is an optional field used to specify the Git push options to be sent to the Git server when pushing commits upstream.

### Kubernetes TLS Secrets

All the Flux APIs that accept TLS data have been modified to adopt Secrets of type
`kubernetes.io/tls`. This includes:
* **HelmRepository**: The field `.spec.secretRef` has been deprecated in favor of a new field [`.spec.certSecretRef`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmrepositories/#cert-secret-reference).
* **OCIRepository**: Support for the `caFile`, `keyFile` and `certFile` keys in the Secret specified in [`.spec.certSecretRef`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositories/#cert-secret-reference) have been deprecated in favor of `ca.crt`, `tls.key` and `tls.crt`.
* **ImageRepository**: Support for the`caFile`, `keyFile` and `certFile` keys in the Secret specified in [`.spec.certSecretRef`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/imagerepositories/#cert-secret-reference) have been deprecated in favor of `ca.crt`, `tls.key` and `tls.crt`.
* **GitRepository**: CA certificate can now be provided in the Secret specified in `.spec.secretRef` using the `ca.crt` key, which takes precedence over the `caFile` key.

      <h2>v2.0.0 (2023-07-05)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This is the first General Availability (GA) release of Flux v2.

Flux v2.0.0 comes with the promotion of the [GitOps related APIs to v1](#api-changes) and adds [horizontal scaling & sharding capabilities](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/sharding/) to Flux controllers. The Git bootstrap capabilities provided by the [Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap) and by [Flux Terraform Provider](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap-with-terraform) are now considered stable and production ready.

Starting with this version, the build, release and provenance portions of the Flux project supply chain [provisionally meet SLSA Build Level 3](https://fluxcd.io/flux/security/slsa-assessment/).

Flux GA is fully integrated with Kubernetes Workload Identity for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud to facilitate [passwordless authentication](https://fluxcd.io/flux/security/contextual-authorization) to OCI sources (container images, OCI artifacts, Helm charts).

The Flux alerting capabilities have been extended with [PagerDuty](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/provider/#pagerduity) and [Google Pub/Sub](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/provider/#google-pubsub) support. The improved Alert v1beta2 API provides better control over [events filtering](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/alert/#event-inclusion) and allows users to enrich the alerts with [custom metadata](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/alert/#event-metadata).

## Supported versions

Starting with this version, the Flux CLI and the GA components (source-controller, kustomize-controller and notification-controller) follow the release cadence and support pledge documented in the [Flux release specification](https://fluxcd.io/flux/releases/).

### Kubernetes compatibility

This release is compatible with the following Kubernetes versions:

| Kubernetes version | Minimum required |
|--------------------|------------------|
| `v1.24`            | `>= 1.24.0`      |
| `v1.25`            | `>= 1.25.0`      |
| `v1.26`            | `>= 1.26.0`      |
| `v1.27`            | `>= 1.27.1`      |

Note that Flux may work on older versions of Kubernetes e.g. 1.19, but we don't recommend running end-of-life versions in production nor do we offer support for these versions.

### Flux ecosystem support

The following (open-source) extensions & integrations are compatible with this Flux release, starting from the specified minimum version or higher.

| Type        | Project                                                                | Version |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Flux Web UI      | [weave-gitops](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops)          | `0.26.0`      |
| Terraform integration | [tf-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller) | `0.15.0`      |

## API changes

### GitRepository v1

The [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/) kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA) and deprecated fields were removed.

The v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, except for the following:

- the deprecated field `.spec.gitImplementation` was removed
- the unused field `.spec.accessFrom` was removed
- the deprecated field `.status.contentConfigChecksum` was removed
- the deprecated field `.status.artifact.checksum` was removed
- the `.status.url` was removed (replaced by `.status.artifact.url`)

### Kustomization v1

The [Kustomization](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/) kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA) and deprecated fields were removed.

A new optional field `.spec.commonMetadata` was added to the API for setting labels and/or annotations to all resources part of a Kustomization.

The v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, except for the following:

- the deprecated field `.spec.validation` was removed
- the deprecated field `.spec.patchesStrategicMerge` was removed (replaced by `.spec.patches`)
- the deprecated field `.spec.patchesJson6902 ` was removed (replaced by `.spec.patches`)

### Receiver v1

The [Receiver](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/receiver/) kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA) and deprecated fields were removed.

The v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, except for the following:

- the deprecated field `.status.url` was removed (replaced by `.status.webhookPath`)

## <a name="upgrade"></a>Upgrade procedure

Upgrade Flux from `v0.x` to `v2.0.0` either by [rerunning bootstrap](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap-upgrade) or by using the [Flux GitHub Action](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/action).

To upgrade the APIs from v1beta2, make sure the new CRDs and controllers are deployed, and then change the manifests in Git:

1. Remove the deprecated fields from the `GitRepository` and `Kustomization` definitions.
2. Commit, push and reconcile the fields removal changes.
3. Set  `apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain `GitRepository` definitions.
4. Set  `apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain Flux `Kustomization` definitions.
5. Set  `apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain `Receiver` definitions.
6. Update the API version of  `GitRepository` and `Kustomization` objects present in the `.spec.resources` list of `Receiver` definitions.
7. Commit, push and reconcile the API version changes.

Bumping the APIs version in manifests can be done gradually. It is advised to not delay this procedure as the beta versions will be removed after 6 months.

      <h2>v2.0.0-rc.5 (2023-06-01)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This is the 5th release candidate of Flux v2.0 GA. Users are advised to upgrade from older versions to `v2.0.0-rc.5` as soon as possible.

Flux `v2.0.0-rc.5` addresses a regression that was introduced in `v2.0.0-rc.4`. This regression caused a disruption in the compatibility with Git servers utilizing v2 of the wire protocol, such as Azure Devops and AWS CodeCommit.

:bulb: For upgrading from v0.x, please see [the procedure documented in RC.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1).

⚠️ Note that [`v2.0.0-rc.4`](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1) updated all components to use [Kustomize v5](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv5.0.0) and [controller-runtime v0.15](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/releases/tag/v0.15.0), both of which contain breaking changes.

### Fixes and improvements

- Fix support for Git v2 servers.
- Suppress misleading error message `[controller-runtime] log.SetLogger(...) was never called...` (CLI).

      <h2>v2.0.0-rc.2 (2023-05-09)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This is the 2nd release candidate of Flux v2.0 GA. Users are advised to upgrade from `v0.41` to `v2.0.0-rc.2` as soon as possible.

Flux v2.0.0-rc.2 comes with fixes to issues reported for RC.1 and performance improvements. Starting with this version, source-controller, kustomize-controller and helm-controller pods are marked as [system-cluster-critical](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/guaranteed-scheduling-critical-addon-pods/). This priority class will reduce the chances of Flux controllers being evicted before other non-critical workloads and prevents the pods from being permanently unavailable.

:bulb: For upgrading from v0.x, please see [the procedure documented in RC.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1).

:warning: Note that Kubernetes 1.27.0 contains a regression bug that affects Flux, it is recommended to upgrade Kubernetes to 1.27.1 or newer.

### Fixes and improvements

- Fix bootstrap for BitBucket Server (CLI).
- Fix secrets decryption when using Azure Key Vault (kustomize-controller).
- Fix drift detection for renamed HelmReleases (helm-controller).
- Improve performance when handling webhook receivers (notification-controller).
- The `Alert` v1beta2 API has a new optional field `.spec.inclusionList` for fine-grained control over events filtering (notification-controller).
- The deprecated field `.status.url` was removed from the `Receiver` v1 API (notification-controller).
- Add support for commit signing using OpenPGP keys with passphrases (image-automation-controller).

      <h2>v2.0.0-rc.1 (2023-04-06)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This is the first release candidate of Flux v2.0 GA :tada:. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

Flux v2.0.0-rc.1 comes with the promotion of the [GitOps related APIs to v1](#api-changes) and adds [horizontal scaling & sharding capabilities](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/sharding/) to Flux controllers.

In addition, RC.1 comes with support for auth with Azure Workload Identity when pulling OCI artifacts from ACR and when decrypting secret with Azure Vault. Also, Bootstrap for GitLab was extended with support for generating [GitLab Deploy Tokens](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#gitlab-and-gitlab-enterprise).

:heart: Big thanks to all the Flux contributors that helped us with this release!
👏  And a special shoutout to the GitLab team for their first contribution to Flux!

## API changes

### GitRepository v1

The [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/) kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA) and deprecated fields were removed.

The  v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, except for the following:
- the deprecated field `.spec.gitImplementation` was removed
- the unused field `.spec.accessFrom` was removed
- the deprecated field `.status.contentConfigChecksum` was removed
- the deprecated field `.status.artifact.checksum` was removed
- the `.status.url` was removed in favor of the absolute `.status.artifact.url`

### Kustomization v1

The [Kustomization](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/) kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA) and deprecated fields were removed.

A new optional field `.spec.commonMetadata` was added to the API for setting labels and/or annotations to all resources part of a Kustomization.

The v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, except for the following:
- the deprecated field `.spec.validation` was removed
- the deprecated field `.spec.patchesStrategicMerge` was removed (replaced by `.spec.patches`)
- the deprecated field `.spec.patchesJson6902 ` was removed (replaced by `.spec.patches`)

### Receiver v1

The [Receiver](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/receiver/) kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA).

The v1 API now supports triggering the reconciliation of multiple resources using `.spec.resources.matchLabels`.

The  v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, no fields were removed.

## Upgrade procedure

Upgrade Flux from `v0.x` to `v2.0.0-rc-1` either by [rerunning flux bootstrap](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap-upgrade) or by using the [Flux GitHub Action](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/action).

To upgrade the APIs from v1beta2, after deploying the new CRDs and controllers, change the manifests in Git:
1. Remove the deprecated fields from the `GitRepository` and `Kustomization` definitions.
2. Commit, push and reconcile the fields removal changes.
3. Set  `apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain `GitRepository` .
4. Set  `apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain `Kustomization` .
5. Set  `apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain `Receiver` definitions.
6. Commit, push and reconcile the API version changes.

Bumping the APIs version in manifests can be done gradually. It is advised to not delay this procedure as the beta
versions will be removed after 6 months.

:warning: Note that this release updates the major version of the Flux Go Module to v2. Please update your `go.mod` to require `github.com/fluxcd/flux2/v2`, see [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fluxcd/flux2/v2) for the documentation of the module.

      <h2>v0.41.1 (2023-03-10)</h2>
      <pre>Flux v0.41.1 is a patch release which extends the helm-controller's OOM watch feature introduced in v0.41.0 with support for automatic detection of cgroup v1 paths, and flags to configure alternative paths using `--oom-watch-max-memory-path` and `--oom-watch-current-memory-path`.

      <h2>v0.41.0 (2023-03-09)</h2>
      <pre>Flux v0.41.0 comes with new features and improvements. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

## Features and improvements

- Experimental support of drift detection of Helm releases compared to cluster-state.
- Improved handling of `SIGTERM` signals received by the helm-controller, which will now terminate running Helm install or upgrade actions, instead of potentially leaving them in a pending state.
- Opt-in OOM watcher in helm-controller to handle graceful termination of the controller before it is forcefully killed by Kubernetes' OOM killer.
- Kubernetes client and Custom Resource Definition life-cycle improvements to reduce the memory consumption of the helm-controller, with observed reductions up to 50%.
- Opt-in allowance of DNS lookups during the rendering of Helm templates in the helm-controller via feature gate.
- Optional disabling of the cache of the status poller used to determine the health of the resources applied by the kustomize-controller. This may improve memory usage on large scale clusters at the cost of more direct API calls.
- Changes to the logging of all controllers to ensure Kubernetes components like the discovery client use the configured logging format.
- New `flux events` command to display Kubernetes events for Flux resources, including the events of a referenced resource.
- Custom annotations can now be set with `flux push` using `--annotations`.

Flux v0.40.0 comes with new features and improvements. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

### Breaking changes

**Image Automation**

The image-reflector-controller autologin flags have been deprecated and are no longer used.
Please see the new API specification and migration instructions in the controller [changelog](https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0250).

**Notifications**

The source revision format reported by the Flux controllers has changed according to [RFC-0005](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/rfcs/0005-artifact-revision-and-digest).
The events referring to Git repositories, will report the revision in the format `<branch|tag>@sha1:<commit>` instead of `<branch|tag>/<commit>`.
For more details please see the source-controller [changelog](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0350).

**OCI artifacts**

The OCI artifacts produced with `flux push artifact` have now custom media types:
- artifact media type `application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json`
- config media type `application/vnd.cncf.flux.config.v1+json`
- content media type `application/vnd.cncf.flux.content.v1.tar+gzip`

### Features and improvements

- The `GitRepository` API has a new optional field `.spec.ref.name`  for specifying a [Git Reference](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References).
  This allows Flux to reconcile resources from GitHub Pull Requests (`refs/pull/<id>/head`) and GitLab Merge Requests (`refs/merge-requests/<id>/head`).
- The `ImageRepository` and `ImagePolicy` APIs have been promoted to `v1beta2`.
- Allow specifying the cloud provider contextual login for container registries with `ImageRepository.spec.provider`.
- Improve observability of `ImageRepository` by showing the latest scanned tags under `.status.lastScanResult.latestTags`.
- Improve observability of `ImagePolicy` by reporting the current and previous image tag in status and events.
- The Kubernetes builtin cluster roles: `view`, `edit` and `admin` have been extended to allow access to Flux custom resources.
- Print a report of Flux custom resources and the amount of cumulative storage used for each source type with `flux stats -A`.

      <h2>v0.39.0 (2023-02-02)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

Flux v0.39.0 comes with new features and improvements. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

Starting with this version, the Flux controllers come with [SBOMs and SLSA Provenance Attestations](https://fluxcd.io/flux/security/) embedded in their container images. 

The [Flux Terraform Provider](https://github.com/fluxcd/terraform-provider-flux) has a new resource for bootstrapping Flux, without depending on third-party Terraform providers, that allows customising the controllers at install time. Users are encouraged to migrate to this new resources and provide feedback.

The Flux CLI is now included in [Wolfi OS](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os), the Linux (Un)distro designed for securing the software supply chain. The Chainguard team and Wolfi maintainers are shipping updates for the Flux package on a regular basis.

### Features and improvements

- Recreate immutable resources (e.g. Kubernetes Jobs) by annotating or labeling them with `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force: enabled`.
- Support for HTTPS bearer token authentication for Git repositories.
- Improve memory usage by disabling the caching of Secret and ConfigMap resources in all controllers.
- Better observability with progressive status updates for Sources (Git, OCI, Helm, S3 Buckets). 
- Allow extracting the OCI artifact SHA256 digest for Cosign with `flux push artifact -o json`.
- Track CRDs managed by Flux, `flux trace` and `flux tree` will show which HelmRelease deployed which CRDs.
- Allow the Flux GitHub Action to use a GitHub token when checking for updates to avoid rate limiting.

### New documentation

- Security: [Software Bill of Materials](https://fluxcd.io/flux/security/#software-bill-of-materials)
- Security: [SLSA Provenance Attestations](https://fluxcd.io/flux/security/#slsa-provenance-attestations)

      <pre>## Highlights

Flux v0.38.0 comes with new features and improvements. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

### Notification API v1beta2

This release graduates the Notification APIs to `v1beta2`. After upgrading the controllers on your clusters, you need to update the notification Custom Resources in Git by replacing `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1` with `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2` in all YAML manifests.

#### Breaking changes

- The `Alert.spec.summary` has a max length of 255 characters.
- The `Provider.spec.address` and `Provider.spec.proxy` have a max length of 2048 characters.
- The `Receiver.status.url` was deprecated in favour of `Receiver.status.webhookPath`.

For more details about `v1beta2` please see the notification-controller [chagelog](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0300) and the [API spec documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/).

### Features and improvements

- Support for defining Kustomize components with `Kustomization.spec.components`.
- Support for piping multi-doc YAMLs when publishing OCI artifacts with `kustomize build . | flux push artifact --path=-`.
- Support for Gitea commit status updates with `Provider.spec.type` set to `gitea`.
- Improve the memory usage of helm-controller by disabling the caching of Secret and ConfigMap resources.
- Update the Helm SDK to v3.10.3 (fix for Helm CVEs).
- All code references to `libgit2` were removed, and the `GitRepository.spec.gitImplementation` field is no longer being honored.

### Documentation improvements

The official [example repository](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example) was refactored.  The new version comes with the following improvements:

- Make the example compatible with ARM64 Kubernetes clusters.
- Add Weave GitOps Helm release to showcase the [Flux UI](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example#access-the-flux-ui).
- Replace the `ingress-nginx` Bitnami chart with the official one that contains multi-arch container images.
- Add `cert-manager` Helm release to showcase how to install CRDs and custom resources using `dependsOn`.
- Add Let's Encrypt `ClusterIssuer` to showcase how to patch resources in production with Flux Kustomization.
- Add the `flux-system` overlay to showcase how to configure Flux at bootstrap time.

      <h2>v0.37.0 (2022-11-22)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

Flux v0.37.0 comes with new features and improvements. Users are encouraged to upgrade for the best experience.

### Breaking changes

#### Deprecation of `gitImplementation`

The interpretation of the `gitImplementation` field of `GitRepository` by source-controller and image-automation-controller has been deprecated, and will effectively always use `go-git`. This now supports all Git servers, including Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit, which previously were only supported by `libgit2`.

To opt-out from this behaviour, and get the controller to honour the field `.spec.gitImplementation`, start the controller with: `--feature-gates=ForceGoGitImplementation=false`.

For more information on this change, refer to the controllers's respective changelogs [listed below](#components-changelog).

#### Automatic force-push of `ImageUpdateAutomation`

Starting from this version, `ImageUpdateAutomation` objects with a `.spec.PushBranch` specified will have the push branch refreshed automatically via force push. To opt-out from this behaviour, start the controller with: `--feature-gates=GitForcePushBranch=false.`

### Features and improvements

- Support for bootstrapping Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit repositories using `flux bootstrap git`.
- Support cloning of Git v2 protocol (Azure DevOps and AWS CodeCommit) for `go-git` Git provider.
- Support force-pushing `ImageUpdateAutomation` repositories.
- Allow a dry-run of `flux build kustomization` with `--dry-run` and `--kustomization-file ./path/to/local/my-app.yaml`. Using these flags, variable substitutions from Secrets and ConfigMaps are skipped, and no connection to the cluster is made.
- Use signed OCI Helm chart for [kube-prometheus-stack](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/monitoring/).

### New documentation

- Guide: [AWS CodeCommit bootstrap](https://fluxcd.io/flux/use-cases/aws-codecommit)
- Guide: [Azure DevOps bootstrap](https://fluxcd.io/flux/use-cases/azure/#flux-installation-for-azure-devops)
