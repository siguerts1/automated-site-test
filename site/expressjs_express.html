      <h2>5.0.0 (2024-09-10)</h2>
      <pre># Express v5.0.0 

🎉 **Express v5 is finally here!** 🎉

After years of development, the long-awaited Express v5 has been officially released. This version focuses on simplifying the codebase, improving security, and dropping support for older Node.js versions to enable better performance and maintainability.

For detailed information, please check out the official [Express v5 release blog post](https://expressjs.com/2024/10/15/v5-release.html).

## Most relevant details

### Major Changes in v5

- **Node.js version support**: Dropped support for Node.js versions before v18.
- **Routing changes**: Updated to `path-to-regexp@8.x`, removing sub-expression regex patterns for security reasons (ReDoS mitigation).
- **Promise support**: Middleware can now return rejected promises, caught by the router as errors.
- **`body-parser` changes**: Several improvements including the ability to customize `urlencoded` body depth and defaulting `extended` to `false`.
- **Deprecated API methods removed**: Removed old, deprecated API method signatures from Express v3/v4.

For a complete list of breaking changes and API deprecations, see the [migration guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html).

### Security Updates

This release includes important security fixes, including improvements to prevent ReDoS attacks and mitigation for CVE-2024-45590. Full details can be found in the [security release notes](https://expressjs.com/2024/09/29/security-releases.html).

### Migration

Be sure to check out our [migration guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html) for instructions on how to update your applications from Express v4 to v5.

### Security Guidance

For best practices, we recommend reviewing the [Threat Model](https://github.com/expressjs/security-wg/blob/main/docs/ThreatModel.md) which outlines Express' approach to securing your applications, including tips for user input validation and other critical aspects.
