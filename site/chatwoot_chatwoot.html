-----

Notes:

We were using FCM legacy APIs to send push notifications to Android and iOS devices. As these APIs were deprecated on June 20, 2023, and will be removed in June 2024, we have added support for HTTP v1 API notifications in the latest version.  Users of Chatwoot cloud and self-hosted instances using the Chatwoot relay server don't need to make any changes. If you are using the mobile app, ensure that you have installed the latest Chatwoot mobile app (1.10.41).

However, for users with a self-hosted server who are not using a relay server, some changes are necessary. You can learn more about these changes here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1
