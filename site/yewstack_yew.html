      <h2>v0.17.0 (2020-06-29)</h2>
      <pre>#### Changelog

- #### ⚡️ Features

  - Allow agents to send input messages to themselves. [[@mkawalec], [#1278](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1278)]
  - Rendering performance has been improved by [~20%](http://static.yew.rs/v0.17-benchmarks.png). [[@jstarry], [#1296](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1296), [#1309](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1309)]
  - `html!`: Elements can be specified with dynamic tag names. [[@siku2], [#1266](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1266)]

      In order to specify a dynamic tag name, wrap an expression with `@{..}`:

      ```rust
      let tag_name = "input";
      html! { <@{tag_name} value="Hello" /> }
      ```
  - HTML button element `type` can now be specified (`"submit"`, `"reset"`, or `"button"`). [[@captain-yossarian], [#1033](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1033)]
  - All global event listeners can be used as listeners (`onerror`, `onloadend`, and many more). [[@siku2], [#1244](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1242)]
  - `PartialEq` is now implemented for `VChild` when properties also implement `PartialEq`. [[@kellpossible], [#1242](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1242)]
  - Agent callbacks now accept `Into<Message>` to improve ergonomics. [[@totorigolo], [#1215](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1215)]
  - Agents can now send messages to themselves. [[@totorigolo], [#1215](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1215)]

- #### 🛠 Fixes

  - Bincode dependency version has been loosened `1.2.1` -> `1`. [[@jstarry], [#1349](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1349)]
  - Keyed list ordering algorithm has been fixed. [[@totorigolo] and [@jstarry], [#1231](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1231)]
  - `html!`: `key` and `ref` are no longer ignored for components with no properties. [[@jstarry], [#1338](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1338)]
  - `html!`: List rendering behavior is consistent no matter which syntax is chosen. [[@siku2], [#1275](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1275)]

      `html! { for node_list }` is now equivalent to `html! { node_list }` when `node_list` is a `Vec<VNode>`.

  - `KeyboardService` events can now have default behavior prevented. [[@ghpu], [#1286](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1286)]
  - Yew will check the current DOM `input` value before comparing with the desired value. [[@ShadoySV], [#1268](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1268)]
  - `html!`: Void elements (`<br/>`, `<input />`) are no longer allowed to have children. [[@kaoet], [#1217](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1217)]
  - Local agents no longer require `Input` and `Output` to implement `Serializable`. [[@mkawalec], [#1195](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1195)]

- #### 🚨 Breaking changes

  - Renders are now done lazily and will not be executed until all updates have been processed. [[@jstarry], [#1309](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1309)]
  - `ConsoleService`, `DialogService`, `IntervalService`, `RenderService`, `TimeoutService`, and `WebSocketService` methods are now static. [[@teymour-aldridge], [#1313](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1313)]
  - `html!`: `Children` no longer implements `Renderable`. [[@siku2], [#1275](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1275)]

      Replace instances of `self.props.children.render()` with `self.props.children.clone()`.

  - Yew no longer stops propagation of events by default. [[@jstarry], [#1256](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1256)]

      Event propagation is usually stopped when you have event listeners attached to nested elements and do not want the event to bubble up from where it was first captured. If your app has this behavior, you can stop propagation by calling `stop_propagation()` on the desired event.

  - The `onsubmit` listener now uses `FocusEvent` instead `Event` when using `web-sys`. [[@siku2], [#1244](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1244)]
  - The `onmousewheel` and `ontouchenter` listeners have been removed. [[@siku2], [#1244](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1244)]
  - The `ondoubleclick` listener is now named `ondblclick`. [[@siku2], [#1244](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1244)]
  - `FetchService` methods are now static. [[@teymour-aldridge], [#1235](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1235)]

      Instead of `FetchService::new().fetch(..)` you should now use `FetchService::fetch(..)`

  - The `send_message_batch` method has been removed from `AgentLink`. [[@totorigolo], [#1215](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1215)]
  - Minimum supported rust version has been bumped from `1.40.0` to `1.42.0`. [[@mkawalec], [#1195](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1195)]
  - Every agent `Reach` type is now generic. [[@mkawalec], [#1195](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1195)]

      In order to fix your app, simply append `<Self>` to the reach:

      `Reach = Context` -> `Reach = Context<Self>`
  - Removed `Global` agent because it was never implemented. [[@jstarry], [#1202](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1202)]
  - Reduced visibility of internal agent types that were not intended to be public. [[@jstarry], [#1202](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1202)]

      <h2>v0.16.0 (2020-05-09)</h2>
      <pre>### Changelog

- #### ⚡️ Features

  - Added optional `id`, `class`, and `placeholder` properties to the `Select` component. [[@Stigjb], [#1187](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1187)]
  - Re-export `web-sys` from Yew. This allows projects to use `web-sys` without adding it to their `Cargo.toml`. [[@D4nte], [#1176](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1176)]
  - Added support for `Option` wrapped class names. [[@liquidblock], [#1085](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1085)]

    The following code is now supported:
    ```rust
    let color: &Option<String> = &self.color;
    html! { <div class=("btn", color)></div> }
    ```

  - Added `get_parent` and `get_component` methods to `ComponentLink` to allow access to parent component state. [[@jstarry], [#1151](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1151)]

- #### 🛠 Fixes

  - Fixed bug that caused html class attributes to be set to an empty string. [[@liquidblock], [#1085](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1085)]
  - Fixed `Private` worker lifecycle event sending. [[@joaquindk], [#1146](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1146)]

- #### 🚨 Breaking changes

  - Bumped minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.40.0. [[@jstarry], [#1152](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1152)]

      <h2>v0.15.0 (2020-04-25)</h2>
      <pre>### Attention!
`yew` now uses `web-sys` by default. If your project uses `web-sys`, you can now drop the `"web_sys"` feature from your yew dependency.
Don't worry `stdweb` users, we have created a new alias crate for y'all called `yew-stdweb`. In order to use it, update your `Cargo.toml` yew dependency to the following:

```toml
yew = { version = "0.15", package = "yew-stdweb" }
```

### Dev Survey Results
Thank you to everyone that took the time to fill out the Yew Dev Survey! 🙇‍♂️

Results have been posted here: https://github.com/yewstack/yew/wiki/Dev-Survey-%5BSpring-2020%5D

### New Chatroom
We moved from Gitter to Discord! Join us: https://discord.gg/VQck8X4

### Changelog

- #### ⚡️ Features

  - Add support for single use callbacks (useful for `TimeoutService`). [[@lukerandall], [#1125](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1125)]
  - Updated scheduler to eagerly destroy components to avoid unnecessary renders. [[@jstarry], [#1072](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1072)]
  - Add support `key` attribute to improve rendering performance. [[@mrh0057], [#1076](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1076)]

- #### 🛠 Fixes

  - Split class names on whitespace when passed within `tuple` or `Vec`. [[@bryanjswift], [#1084](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1084)]

- #### 🚨 Breaking changes

  - The `components` module has been moved out `yew` and into `yew-components`. [[@jstarry], [#1132](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1132)]
  - Replaced `mounted` component lifecycle method with `rendered` which is called after each render. [[@jstarry], [#1072](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1072)]
  - Components must now implement the `change` method (forgetting this was a very common issue). [[@jstarry], [#1071](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1071)]
  - Yew now builds with `web-sys` by default. [[@jstarry], [#1092](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1092)]

  - Fixed interval and timer usage in `web-sys` workers by updating `gloo`. [[@jstarry], [#1018](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1018)]
  - Send `Connected` message for Public agents. [[@TheNeikos], [#1007](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1007)]
  - Fixed `web-sys` Public / Private agent initialization. [[@jstarry], [#1006](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1006)]
  - Fixed websocket 'text' message handling for `web-sys` agents. [[@jstarry], [#1005](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1005)]

- #### 🚨 Breaking changes

  - `FetchError::FetchFailed` enum variant now wraps a `String` to hold the failure reason. [[@jstarry], [#1025](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/1025)]
  - Message APIs now accept `Into<Msg>`, so calling `msg.into()` will cause compile errors. [[@captain-yossarian], [#999](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/999)]

      <h2>v0.13.0 (2020-03-01)</h2>
      <pre>#### `web-sys` support has arrived!

[@daxpedda] spear-headed the effort and courageously integrated `web-sys` while maintaining support for `stdweb` through no small amount of `cfg` macro usage. We chose to continue support for apps built with `stdweb` because the dev experience is still quite a bit better _(Unfortunately `cargo-web` is incompatible with `web-sys`)_. However, the Yew team recognizes that the future of `cargo-web` of `stdweb` are uncertain. For this reason, we recommend devs start making the switch over to `web-sys` and `wasm-bindgen`. We will likely invest in improving the dev experience with these tools so that switching over is eventually a no-brainer. Please reach out with ideas and feedback for this migration through Github issues and in our Gitter chatroom!

After upgrading to v0.13, devs will now have to opt in to either `stdweb` or `web-sys` by using either the `"web_sys"` or `"std_web"` on the `yew` crate in their `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
# Choose `stdweb`
yew = { version = "0.13", features = ["std_web"] }

# Choose `web-sys`
yew = { version = "0.13", features = ["web_sys"] }
```

Lastly, take note that API docs on https://docs.rs/yew will be using the `"web_sys"` feature. For `"std_web"` docs, please visit https://docs.rs/yew-stdweb.

      <h2>v0.11.0 (2020-01-06)</h2>
      <pre>This release aims to lay the groundwork for Yew component libraries as well as clean up the API for the ever elusive 1.0 release 😜 

### Transition Guide

This release comes with a lot of breaking changes. We understand it's a hassle to update projects but the Yew team felt it was necessary to rip a few bandaids off now as we approach a 1.0 release in the (hopefully) near future. To ease the transition, here's a guide which outlines the main refactoring you will need to do for your project. (Note: all of the changes are reflected in the many example projects if you would like a proper reference example)

#### 1. Callback syntax

This is the main painful breaking change. It applies to both element listeners as well as `Component` callback properties. A good rule of thumb is that your components will now have to retain a `ComponentLink` to create callbacks on demand or initialize callbacks in your component's `create()` method.

Before:
```rust
struct Model;

enum Msg {
    Click,
}

impl Component for Model {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Model
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Click => true,
        }
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html<Self> {
        // BEFORE: Callbacks were created implicitly from this closure syntax
        html! {
            <button onclick=|_| Msg::Click>{ "Click me!" }</button>
        }
    }
}
```

After:
```rust
struct Model {
  link: ComponentLink<Self>,
}

enum Msg {
    Click,
}

impl Component for Model {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Model { link }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        match msg {
            Msg::Click => true,
        }
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        // AFTER: Callbacks need to be explicitly created now
        let onclick = self.link.callback(|_| Msg::Click);
        html! {
            <button onclick=onclick>{ "Click me!" }</button>
        }
    }
}
```

If a closure has a parameter you will now need to specify the parameter's type.  A tip for finding the appropriate type is to search Yew's repo for the HTML attribute the closure is assigned to.

For example, `onkeydown` of `<button>`:

```rust
let onkeydown = self.link.callback(|e: KeyDownEvent| {
    // ...
});
```

and

```rust
html! {
    <button onkeydown=onkeydown type="button">
        { "button" }
    </button>
}
```

#### 2. Method Renames

It should be safe to do a project-wide find/replace for the following:

- `send_self(` -> `send_message(`
- `send_back(` -> `callback(`
- `response(` -> `respond(`
- `AgentUpdate` -> `AgentLifecycleEvent`

These renames will probably require some more care:

- `fn handle(` -> `fn handle_input(` *(for Agent trait implementations)*

#### 3. Drop Generic Types for `Html<Self>` -> `Html`

:tada: We are pretty excited about this change! The generic type parameter
was confusing and restrictive and is now a thing of the past!

Before:
```rust
impl Component for Model {
    // ...

    fn view(&self) -> Html<Self> {
        html! { /* ... */ }
    }
}
```

After:
```rust
impl Component for Model {
    // ...

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! { /* ... */ }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Properties must implement `Clone`

In yew v0.8 we removed the requirement that component properties implement `Clone`
and in this release we are adding the requirement again. This change is needed
to improve the ergonomics of nested components. The only time properties will be
cloned is when a wrapper component re-renders nested children components.

---

### Changelog

- #### ⚡️ Features

  - Added `html_nested!` macro to support nested iterable children access. [[@trivigy], [#843](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/843)]
  - Added `bincode` to the list of supported formats. [[@serzhiio], [#806](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/806)]
  - Added a `noop()` convenience method to `Callback` which creates a no-op callback. [[@mdtusz], [#793](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/793)]
  - The `html!` macro now accepts a `Callback` for element listeners. [[@jstarry], [#777](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/777)]

  ```rust
  struct Model {
      onclick: Callback<ClickEvent>,
  }

  enum Msg {
      Click,
  }

  impl Component for Model {
      type Message = Msg;
      type Properties = ();

      fn create(_: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
          Model {
              onclick: link.callback(|_| Msg::Click),
          }
      }

      fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
          match msg {
              Msg::Click => true,
          }
      }

      fn view(&self) -> Html {
          html! {
              <button onclick=&self.onclick>{ "Click me!" }</button>
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  - Add `send_message_batch` method to `ComponentLink`. [[@hgzimmerman], [#748](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/748)]
  - Allow compilation to `wasi` target without `wasm_bindgen`. [[@dunnock], [#746](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/746)]
  - `AgentLink` now implements `Clone` which enables `Future` usage without explicit Yew framework support. [[@izissise], [#802](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/802)]
  - `ComponentLink` now implements `Clone` which enables `Future` usage without explicit Yew framework support. [[@hgzimmerman], [#749](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/749)]

  ```rust
  use wasm_bindgen::JsValue;
  use wasm_bindgen_futures::future_to_promise;

  // future must implement `Future<Output = Component::Message> + 'static`
  let link = self.link.clone();
  let js_future = async move {
      link.send_message(future.await);
      Ok(JsValue::NULL)
  };

  future_to_promise(js_future);
  ```

- #### 🛠 Fixes

  - Fixed handling of boolean tag attributes. [[@mrh0057], [#840](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/840)]
  - Improved nested component ergonomics. [[@jstarry], [#780](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/780)]

  ```rust
  fn view(&self) -> Html {
      html! {
          <Wrapper>
              // This is now valid. (before #780, this would cause a lifetime
              // compile error because children nodes were moved into a closure)
              <Nested on_click=&self.nested_on_click />
          </Wrapper>
      }
  }
  ```

  - Creating a `Callback` with `ComponentLink` is no longer restricted to mutable references, improving ergonomics. [[@jstarry], [#780](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/780)]
  - The `Callback` `reform` method no longer consumes self making it easier to "reverse map" a `Callback`. [[@jstarry], [#779](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/779)]

  ```rust
  pub struct ListHeader {
      props: Props,
  }

  #[derive(Properties, Clone)]
  pub struct Props {
      #[props(required)]
      pub on_hover: Callback<Hovered>,
      #[props(required)]
      pub text: String,
  }

  impl Component for ListHeader {
      type Message = ();
      type Properties = Props;

      fn create(props: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
          ListHeader { props }
      }

      fn update(&mut self, _: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
          false
      }

      fn view(&self) -> Html {
          let onmouseover = self.props.on_hover.reform(|_| Hovered::Header);
          html! {
              <div class="list-header" onmouseover=onmouseover>
                  { &self.props.text }
              </div>
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  - Reduced allocations in the `Classes` `to_string` method. [[@hgzimmerman], [#772](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/772)]
  - Empty string class names are now filtered out to prevent panics. [[@jstarry], [#770](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/770)]

- #### 🚨 Breaking changes

  - Components with generic args now need to be closed with the full type path. (e.g. `html! { <Wrapper<String>></Wrapper<String>>}`) [[@jstarry], [#837](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/837)]
  - Changed `VTag` listener type from `Box<dyn Listener>` to `Rc<dyn Listener>`. [[@jstarry], [#786](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/786)]
  - `Properties` need to implement `Clone` again in order to improve nested component ergonomics. [[@jstarry], [#786](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/786)]
  - Removed `send_future` method from `ComponentLink` since it is no longer necessary for using Futures with Yew. [[@hgzimmerman], [#799](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/799)]
  - Removed generic type parameter from `Html` and all virtual node types: `VNode`, `VComp`, `VTag`, `VList`, `VText`, etc. [[@jstarry], [#783](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/783)]
  - Removed support for macro magic closure syntax for element listeners. (See transition guide for how to pass a `Callback` explicitly instead). [[@jstarry], [#782](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/782)]
  - Renamed `Agent` methods and event type for clarity. `handle` -> `handle_input`, `AgentUpdate` -> `AgentLifecycleEvent`, `response` -> `respond`. [[@philip-peterson], [#751](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/751)]
  - The `ComponentLink` `send_back` method has been renamed to `callback` for clarity. [[@jstarry], [#780](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/780)]
  - The `ComponentLink` `send_self` and `send_self_batch` methods have been renamed to `send_message` and `send_message_batch` for clarity. [[@jstarry], [#780](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/780)]
  - The `Agent` `send_back` method has been renamed to `callback` for clarity. [[@jstarry], [#780](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/780)]
  - The `VTag` `children` value type has changed from `Vec<VNode>` to `VList`. [[@jstarry], [#754](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/754)]

      <h2>v0.10 (2019-11-11)</h2>
      <pre>Back to the...

- #### ⚡️ Features

  - `Future` support :tada: A `Component` can update following the completion of a `Future`. Check out [this example](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/tree/master/examples/futures) to see how it works. This approach was borrowed from a fork of Yew called [`plaster`](https://github.com/carlosdp/plaster) created by [@carlosdp]. [[@hgzimmerman], [#717](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/717)]
  - Added the `agent` and `services` features so that those modules can be disabled (useful if you are switching to using `Future`s). [[@hgzimmerman], [#684](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/684)]
  - Add `ref` keyword for allowing a `Component` to have a direct reference to its rendered elements. For example, you can now easily focus an `<input>` element after mounting. [[@jstarry], [#715](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/715)]

  ```rust
  use stdweb::web::html_element::InputElement;
  use stdweb::web::IHtmlElement;
  use yew::*;

  pub struct Input {
      node_ref: NodeRef,
  }

  impl Component for Input {
      type Message = ();
      type Properties = ();

      fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
          Input {
              node_ref: NodeRef::default(),
          }
      }

      fn mounted(&mut self) -> ShouldRender {
          if let Some(input) = self.node_ref.try_into::<InputElement>() {
              input.focus();
          }
          false
      }

      fn update(&mut self, _: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
          false
      }

      fn view(&self) -> Html<Self> {
          html! {
              <input ref=self.node_ref.clone() type="text" />
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  - Make `Agent` related types `public` to allow other crates to create custom agents. [[@dunnock], [#721](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/721)]
  - `Component::change` will now return `false` for components that have `Component::Properties == ()`. [[@kellytk], [#690](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/690)]]
  - Updated `wasm-bindgen` dependency to `0.2.54`. Please update your `wasm-bindgen-cli` tool by running `cargo install --force --version 0.2.54 -- wasm-bindgen-cli`. [[@jstarry], [#730](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/730)], [[@ctaggart], [#681](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/681)]

- #### 🛠 Fixes

  - Fixed the mount order of components. The root component will be mounted after all descendants have been mounted. [[@jstarry], [#725](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/725)]
  - All public items now implement `Debug`. [[@hgzimmerman], [#673](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/673)]

- #### 🚨 Breaking changes

  - Minimum rustc version has been bumped to `1.39.0` for `Future` support. [[@jstarry], [#730](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/730)]
  - `Component` now has a required `view` method and automatically implements the `Renderable` trait. The `view` method in the `Renderable` trait has been renamed to `render`. [[@jstarry], [#563](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/563)]

    Before:
    ```rust
    impl Component for Model {
        type Message = Msg;
        type Properties = ();

        fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
            Model {}
        }

        fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
            true
        }
    }

    impl Renderable<Model> for Model {
        fn view(&self) -> Html<Self> {
            html! { "hello" }
        }
    }
    ```

    After:
    ```rust
    impl Component for Model {
        type Message = Msg;
        type Properties = ();

        fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
            Model {}
        }

        fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
            true
        }

        fn view(&self) -> Html<Self> {
            html! { "hello" }
        }
    }
    ```

  - Removed the `Transferable` trait since it did no more than extend the serde `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits. [[@hgzimmerman], [#319](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/319)]

    Before:
    ```rust
    impl Transferable for Input {}
    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
    pub enum Input {
      Connect,
    }
    ```

    After:
    ```rust
    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
    pub enum Input {
      Connect,
    }
    ```
  - `WebSocketService::connect` will now return a `Result` in order to stop panicking on malformed urls. [[@lizhaoxian], [#727](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/727)]
  - `VTag` now is boxed within `VNode` to shrink the size of its enum representation. [[@hgzimmerman], [#675](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/675)]

Happy Canadian Thanksgiving! 🦃

- #### ⚡️ Features

  - Implemented `Default` trait for `VNode` so that `unwrap_or_default` can be called on `Option<Html<Self>>`. [[@hgzimmerman], [#672](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/672)]
  - Implemented `PartialEq` trait for `Classes` so that is more ergonomic to use `Classes` type in component props. [[@hgzimmerman], [#680](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/680)]
  - Updated `wasm-bindgen` dependency to `0.2.50`. Please update your `wasm-bindgen-cli` tool by running `cargo install --force --version 0.2.50 -- wasm-bindgen-cli`. [[@jstarry], [#695](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/695)]

- #### 🛠 Fixes

  - Fixed issue where text nodes were sometimes rendered out of order. [[@jstarry], [#697](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/697)]
  - Fixed regression introduced in 0.9.0 that prevented tag attributes from updating properly. [[@jstarry], [#698](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/698)]
  - Fixed emscripten builds by pinning the version for the `ryu` downstream dependency. [[@jstarry], [#703](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/703)]
  - Updated `stdweb` to `0.4.20` which fixed emscripten builds and unblocked updating `wasm-bindgen` to `0.2.50`. [[@ctaggart], [@jstarry], [#683](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/683), [#694](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/694)]
  - Cleaned up build warnings for missing `dyn` keywords. [[@benreyn], [#687](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/687)]
