      <h2>v1.8.0 ‚òÄÔ∏è (2020-08-22)</h2>
      <pre>v1.8.0 addresses a minor regression with the variable extraction when using a wildcard host match. Specifying `.Host(‚Äúfoo.example.com:{port:.*})` will now correctly capture the port into `mux.Vars`.

      <h2>v1.7.2 (2019-05-17)</h2>
      <pre>‚ö†Ô∏è This release relaxes the host:port matching when using [`*Route.Host()`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#Route.Host) as introduced in [v1.7.0](https://github.com/gorilla/mux/releases/tag/v1.7.0). If a port is _not_ provided, the route will match on any port, matching behaviour for all versions of mux prior to v1.7.0.

See #447 for a fuller discussion.

## CHANGELOG

* Route.Host -matching will ignore any provided port from getHost(), if‚Ä¶ (#447) @cognusion

      <h2>ü¶ç v1.7.0 (2019-01-27)</h2>
      <pre>## Notable changes:

* mux will only support Go 1.7 and newer: this has allowed us to remove the older `gorilla/context` code. Go 1.7 has been out since August 2016.
* [`*Route.Host()`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#Route.Host) matching now includes the `host:port`, as opposed to just the `host`.
* Subrouters should correctly return a 405 if the route matches but the method does not (see #437 for details)

## CHANGELOG

* [deps] Add go.mod for versioned Go (#376) @elithrar
* Initialize user map (#371) @kalafut
* Update LICENSE & AUTHORS files. (#386) @elithrar

      <h2>v1.6.2 ‚ö°Ô∏è (2018-05-13)</h2>
      <pre>Adds the [`CORSMethodMiddleware`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#CORSMethodMiddleware) middleware, which allows package users to automatically generate a `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` HTTP response header based on which methods are configured for a given route. This is useful when dealing with cross-origin requests, and can be easily enabled via `router.Use(mux.CORSMethodMiddleware)`.

This release otherwise includes documentation fixes and improvements. We are always looking to improve the documentation for mux, and contributions are welcome!

      <h2>First Class Middleware Support (2018-01-16)</h2>
      <pre>gorilla/mux now provides first-class support for "middleware" thanks to @roobre! Middleware are handlers that can intercept request & response processing *after a route match*, but before/after other handlers are invoked. See the documentation for the full details: https://github.com/gorilla/mux#middleware

Previously, developers would have to use a thin wrapper to achieve this per-application. Requests for this functionality built up enough over time such that we've added it to mux's built-in methods.

53c1911 [feat] Add middleware support as discussed in #293 (#294)

      <h2>v1.6.0 (2017-11-07)</h2>
      <pre>v1.6.0 major changes:

* `RouteMatch.MatchErr` is now set to `ErrNotFound` when the route does not match.
* Go 1.5.x and below are no longer supported
* New methods for fetching the query template have been added in [`Route.GetQueriesRegexp`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#Route.GetQueriesRegexp) and [`Route.GetQueriesTemplates`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#Route.GetQueriesTemplates)
* Bug fixes and documentation updates, detailed below.

      <h2>v1.5.0 (2017-09-12)</h2>
      <pre>v1.5.0 major changes:

* A HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" will be returned when the method does not match for the route. This is a change from existing behaviour, where a 404 is returned instead. This behaviour, and the error message, can be customized by setting the [`MethodNotAllowed`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#Router) property of a `*Router` instance.
* [`Walk`](https://godoc.org/github.com/gorilla/mux#Router.Walk) will now walk all attached sub-routers

      <h2>v1.3.0 (2017-01-18)</h2>
      <pre>Summary
- Capture groups in regular expressions - e.g. `(pattern|thing)` vs `(?:pattern|thing)` are have not been supported. We now fail fast (panic on startup) if we detect any routes with a capturing group. See https://github.com/gorilla/mux/issues/200 for discussion.

      <h2>v1.2.0 (2017-01-17)</h2>
      <pre>Summary:
- `PathPrefix` now supports defining an index path by calling `PathPrefix("/foo")` and defining a route as `/`
- Documented the regex support - capture groups should not be provided.
- Fix encoded path & variable extraction bugs.

      <h2>v1.1 "Long Overdue" (2016-03-26)</h2>
      <pre>We're now tagging releases with SemVer, something that was long overdue. gorilla/mux has strict API compatibility guarantees, excepting any security issues, but we understand that being able to vendor specific versions is a useful feature.

Minor breaking changes (i.e. regex functionality) will be treated as minor releases.

We also strongly recommend that you stay up to date: although this project has not had any security issues to date, back-porting security patches across multiple releases (v1.1.1, v1.2.1, etc.) is not maintianable for us.
