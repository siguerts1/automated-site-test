      <h2>v5.11.3 — Twenty chocolate nodules (2023-08-29)</h2>
      <pre>Hello all, Truffle now supports Node 20! 🎉

That being the case, we've also finally dropped support for Node 14.  Of course Node 14 went end-of-life quite a while back, 🗓️ but we'd kept support for it up until we had Node 20 working.  And now it is!  Together with that, we've updated Ganche to Ganache 7.9.1.

There are some additional minor updates this week.  The list of Sourcify networks has been updated once again. 🌐  However, we've also disabled the check here, so the Sourcify fetcher can now be used with networks we haven't bothered to add to the list, should we be tardy with any updates.  Also, we fixed a small problem in the debugger that could crop up if you used modifier arguments together with user-defined value types. 👷

That's it for now! 👋

## How to upgrade

We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:

```
npm uninstall -g truffle
npm install -g truffle
```

## Changelog

### Enhancements

      <h2>5.11.0 — Apple pie, no bugs allowed (2023-07-14)</h2>
      <pre>Hey again everyone, welcome back! 👯

This week's release contains a special new feature; we have ported our CLI debugger 🙅🏽‍♀️🐛 over to work with Truffle Dashboard! So now you can step through your Solidity code in the browser! After installing the new version of Truffle, run `truffle dashboard` on the command line. After Truffle Dashboard starts up, just navigate to the URL specified and you can get started! There may be a few preparation steps for you to get up-and-running with your code, so expand the information below for more! We hope you enjoy it and, as always, let us know if you find some bugs so that we can improve it!

<details>
<summary>--more on getting started with the dashboard debugger--</summary>
The first thing you will want to do is connect MetaMask to Dashboard using the button in the lower left. Then switch MetaMask to use the network you are interested in. 

To use the debugger to step through code, Truffle Dashboard will first need to have the compilations for the contracts involved. If the sources are verified on Etherscan, then using the debugger is simple: enter your transaction hash in the input field and click Debug. Truffle will automatically fetch them for you and compile them! If you are debugging a transaction and you have the sources locally in a Truffle or HardHat project, you can send them to Truffle Dashboard using one of the following two methods...

**For Truffle projects** 🍫
If you have a Truffle project with the source files, you should first open Truffle Dashboard by running `truffle dashboard` in a terminal. Once Truffle Dashboard is running, navigate in a web browser to the URL specified. You should see a page with "Truffle Dashboard" in the top left. In another terminal, navigate to your Truffle project directory and run `truffle develop`. After the development 
console opens up, run `migrate --compile-all`. After you migration is complete, Truffle Dashboard will have your compilations saved in the browser! You can then enter the transaction hash you are interested in in the Dashboard Debugger and click Debug! The debugger will load up your session and you can then step through your transaction. Neat!

**For HardHat projects** 👷‍♀️
If you have a HardHat project with the source files, you should open Truffle Dashboard by running `truffle dashboard` in a terminal. Once Truffle Dashboard is running, navigate in a web browser to the URL specified. You should see a page with "Truffle Dashboard" in the top-left. In another terminal window, navigate to your HardHat project's root directory and install the @truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin by running `npm install @truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin`. In your `hardhat-config.ts`, add `import "@truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin"` to the top of the file. Then run `npx hardhat compile` to send the compilations to Truffle Dashboard where
they will be saved in the browser! You can then enter the transaction hash you are interested in in the Dashboard Debugger and click Debug! The debugger will load up your session and you can then step through your transaction. Voila!

**Note 1**: You can verify that the compilation was received by opening the developer console in your browser. Set the logging levels to "all levels" and you should see a "received cli-event message" that looks something like the screenshot below.
<img width="606" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 2 48 16 PM" src="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/assets/14827965/f538ad87-a191-48a1-8d89-322b469f8faf">

**Note 2**: The debugger is a bit resource-intensive and slow to initialize, and may even lock up your browser for a short time. But get yourself a coffee, and hopefully before you return it will be up and running! 💜
</details>

So the debugger for Truffle Dashboard is the meat 🍖 of this week's release. Besides that, we have a handful of maintenance-related PRs; some debugger/decoder-related bug fixes and a bump to the Ganache version utilized by Truffle. We also have to give a shoutout to @BreadQL for making a teeny tiny edit to a README in Truffle. Thanks!

We hope you all enjoy the weekend and we'll see you soon!

      <h2>v5.10.2 — Icebox cake (2023-06-30)</h2>
      <pre>## How to upgrade

Welcome to another Truffle release!

This week we have a small set of updates, focused on improving the decoding and debugging experience. 🚈 Our Decoder's input interfaces are now more flexible; 🤸 it accepts both `string`'s and `bigint`'s in places where only `number`'s were accepted. Additionally, address value now has a `contractClass` interpretation field that may provide additional information like contract name and payability. 📚

We also updated our source fetcher 🧲 to support the layer-2 Rollux blockchain mainnet and testnet.

Stay tuned for more next week! Enjoy the rest of your week. 🦆

We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:

```
npm uninstall -g truffle
npm install -g truffle
```

## Changelog

### New feature
* Add `contractClass` interpretation to address values ([#6130](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6130) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))

### Enhancements
* Allow strings and bigints instead of numbers in decoder input fields ([#6131](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6131) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))
* Add Rollux & its testnet to Sourcify fetcher ([#6127](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6127) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))

      <h2>v5.10.1 — Rum baba (2023-06-23)</h2>
      <pre>Hey everybody! Here's a Truffle release that will end your Friday with joy. 👨‍🍳

If you're using Truffle Test, Debugger, or Decoder, you'll be happy to know that our event decoding is improved to support contracts that use Solidity >= 0.8.20. 🕺 And if you're a fan of Yul, our Decoder can now properly decode internal function pointers from contracts compiled with `viaIR` enabled. 👟 With these cases covered, it means decoding everywhere inside Truffle is hardened to give you a more stable experience.

Thanks to @calebyouki for bringing our attention to an issue related to the programmatic usage of `@truffle/test`. 🪂 We've gone ahead and fixed that. Additionally, thank you to @73alexstep, @vlasov-hub, @BIOtrice, @elenaqi, and @HelenCodePro for looking after our readme's, cheers and welcome! 🐣

As per usual, our fetchers are kept up to date to reflect what Etherscan and Sourcify currently support. 🏌️ We also made an improvement to a codec component.

Try a rum baba if you can find one. 🥃 If not, well, still have a good weekend! We'll be back next week with more.

      <h2>v5.10.0 — Chocolate fountain (2023-06-16)</h2>
      <pre>Hello everyone, we've got a new Truffle for you!

The biggest addition this week is the new package `@truffle/codec-components`!  If you're making use of the `@truffle/decoder` or `@truffle/debugger` 🕵 libraries, you may have found yourself saying, this output format is quite nice, but how do I display it on a webpage? 🕸️  Well, `@truffle/codec-components` gives you a convenient way of doing so!  Behold!

![image](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/assets/35589221/108d2d64-b980-4243-8e7c-ed6acc7b3234)

Look at that those collapsible arrays!  This library is still pretty internal for now, but you can look forward to its use in Truffle features to come.  And we are working on documentation and interfaces to make it more generally available in the future!

Speaking of `@truffle/decoder`, we've upgraded it so that it can make use of [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/) 📖 to decode transactions it otherwise can't make sense of.  In order to use this, you'll need to pass `{ projectInfo: <...>, selectorDirectory: { enabled: true } }` when starting it up.  (You can also set it to use a website other than [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/), so long as you have one that follows the same protocol. 🕴️)

If you do this, then when you get back a message decoding or unknown decoding, it may have attached a `selectorBasedDecodings` interpretation; this will be an array of decodings based on what can be found on [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/).  Note such decodings will be pretty bare-bones 🩻, but they'll be there!

But we've got other enhancements this week as well!  Thanks to @farcaller, you can now override the copy of chai ☕ used for `assert` and `expect` in `truffle test` 🧪 by putting a different package in your config.  Just write
```javascript
module.exports = {
  //rest of truffle-config.js
  chai: {
    package: require("my-preferred-chai")
  }
}
```
and you should be good to go!

Also this week, the `truffle dashboard` command now allows a `--no-auto-open` option to prevent it from automatically opening a browser window 🪟; we've fixed some bugs 🐛 that prevented some people from compiling, decoding, or debugging their contracts; and we've updated what chains you can use `truffle debug -x` or `truffle call -x` with. ⛓️

We hope that's enough for you for one release!  But if it isn't, well, come back next week!

      <h2>v5.9.4 — Bowlful of berries (2023-06-06)</h2>
      <pre>Hello again everyone! 👋

This week we have a few improvements for you. 🛠️ One impacts `truffle call` and makes Truffle more accurately resolve function overloads. More accuracy is always better! 📐 Additionally there is an update that improves the way Truffle Dashboard operates when using the Frame wallet. It used to hang when no account was connected but Truffle now produces some helpful output in that case. Nice!

We hope your week goes well and we'll see you next time!

We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:

```
npm uninstall -g truffle
npm install -g truffle
```

      <h2>v5.9.0 — Chocolate Telephone (2023-05-11)</h2>
      <pre>Ring ring ring, it's Truffle 5.9.0!

### `truffle call`

This week's Truffle release introduces the new `truffle call` command!  You can use it to make read-only calls ☎ to your contracts (or external ones, see below) and display the results.  Just type `truffle call ContractName functionName`, followed by the list of arguments.  You can also use the function's full ABI-style signature in place of the function name, which can be useful for resolving overloads.

You can also use an address in place of a contract name... and if you pass the `--fetch-external` option (or `-x` for short), you can use it with external contracts verified on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) or [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/), and Truffle will automatically download and compile the source to allow to you interact with it. 🌐

The `truffle call` command is powered by Truffle Encoder and Truffle Decoder, so it not only displays detailed decoding information, but also has a ***powerful overload resolution system*** that can resolve which overload you wanted not only based on how many arguments you supplied, but on their types. 🧠  Write yourself some overloaded functions and try it out!  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  (Note that correct overload resolution by name and arguments is never a guarantee and you may need to specify the full signature in cases where you need that guarantee. 🧑‍⚖️ )

### What do we mean by "powerful overload resolution"? 🤔 

You might have in the past had to write things like `myFunction(address,address,string,uint160)` , where you needed to tediously specify the full signature. This is because Solidity allows you to write functions with the same name that take different arguments:

```solidity
contract Example {
  function register(string memory name) public {
    /* ... */
  }

  function register(bytes memory id) public {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

Many tools refuse to make a guess at which `register()` you want when you do `register("0xabcdef")`, instead forcing you to do the work of specifying `register(string)` or `register(bytes)`, and in this case could tell that you obviously meant `register(bytes)`. This gets annoying if you have a lot of arguments, especially if you have to change them later!

In contrast, `truffle call` uses @truffle/encoder's sophisticated heuristics to make the most educated guess possible about which overload you intend.  This means less boilerplate between you and getting the data you want!

Thanks so much to @sukanyaparashar for getting this started for us!

### Other improvements (including ENS primary names inside `truffle debug`!)

But that's not the only substantial improvement going out this week... Truffle Debugger now supports ENS reverse resolution when decoding!  Now, when decoding, addresses (including contracts) with reverse ENS records will have their ENS primary name displayed alongside their ethereum address. 🕵  You can use the default ENS registry for the network you're on if there is one, or you can [specify a registry in your config](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/concepts/ethereum-name-service/), or you can use the `--registry` option to specify one at the command line.  There's also `--no-ens` option to turn this feature off.

</details>

We've also got a few small bug fixes, and we've updated the list of Sourcify networks allowed in `trufle debug --fetch-external`.

And we'll be back soon with yet more improvements to Truffle!  See you all!

      <h2>v5.8.4 (2023-04-28)</h2>
      <pre>Hello all!  We've just got one small fix 🔧 this week, courtesy of @d10r.  The buffer size has been increased when compiling using a native-binary copy of `solc`, allowing for compilation of larger projects in such cases.  We intend to revisit this in the future with a more comprehensive solution that won't require you to make a PR if the buffer size still isn't high enough for you! 🦾

...and, well, that's it for this week.  But we've got big things coming down the pipeline... 🧪

## How to upgrade

We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:

```
npm uninstall -g truffle

      <h2>v5.8.0 — Homemade Four-Layer Carrot Cake (2023-03-10)</h2>
      <pre>Hello! 👋 It's time for another Truffle release!

This week, we're introducing the Truffle Dashboard Hardhat plugin.  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8952139/224185345-83c1f5d5-ef2e-4fbb-8339-073d23126c15.png"  width="5%" height="5%">

This plugin enables you to see decoded transaction information (both the function signature and the values of any arguments passed) when using [Truffle Dashboard](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/use-the-truffle-dashboard/) with your Hardhat projects. It extends `npx hardhat compile` by sending the compiled artifacts to Truffle Dashboard, which in turn uses @truffle/decoder for decoding, giving you that extra degree of visibility before signing the transactions with your browser-based wallet.

You can install this plugin with `npm` (or `yarn`) by running:

```bash
npm i @truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin -D
```

Beyond that, simply import the plugin in your `hardhat.config.js`:

```ts
import "@truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin";
```

Truffle Dashboard allows developers to deploy their applications using a browser-based wallet instead of through local key management. For details on how to use the Truffle Dashboard, take a look at the documentation [here](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/use-the-truffle-dashboard/). 🎉

That's it for this week! We hope you enjoy this new feature. Please let us know what you think!

      <h2>v5.7.7 – Cranberry Orange Upside Down Cake (2023-02-17)</h2>
      <pre>Hello hello! 👋 It's time for another Truffle release! 

This week, we have a little bit of everything for you! Truffle should now properly return an error when it is due to an out of gas exception! 🎉 Previously, these were coming back as custom errors without further information. Additionally, you can now see a link to the Truffle Debugger documentation in the CLI when using it! 👀 Always nice to have more information at your fingertips! ⌨️

Special thanks to [@sukanyaparashar](https://github.com/sukanyaparashar) for upgrading the `solc` dependencies to v0.8.18 in `contract-schema` and `compile-solidity` packages! 🙏

      <h2>v5.7.6 – Classic chocolate fondue (2023-02-11)</h2>
      <pre>Hi folks! Nice seeing you today 🤩 

This week's Truffle release brings you fixes to some bugs that got surfaced internally. Hopefully these bugs didn't affect you, or maybe you were too busy dipping pieces of fruit into melted chocolate to open an issue 😮 🍍 🍓.  In any case, we recommend reading on and upgrading!

Most notably: you can now switch accounts between transactions in Truffle Dashboard. This wasn't working correctly, which meant problems if (e.g.) your deployment process requires multiple accounts to sign different transactions... not great 🙀! Fortunately, this is now fixed and you can feel free to use Truffle Dashboard for all your CLI-driven signature needs, no matter how many counter-parties you want to involve in your smart contracts. 📄 🖊️

Besides that, Truffle's interactive console (i.e., in `truffle develop` and `truffle console`) now properly interprets quoted strings... e.g., now `"two words"` gets treated as only one string, the way you'd expect! We've also fixed the behavior of our help system inside the interactive console, so now `help` inside Truffle's console behaves the same as `truffle help` on the command line. ℹ️ 

Special shout-out to @sukanyaparashar for updating our `truffle init` output to the latest Solidity! Thanks for getting that for us 🙏.

Scroll down for all the details if you'd like... regardless, take care and thanks for reading! 👋

      <h2>v5.7.5 — Chocolate chips (2023-02-02)</h2>
      <pre>Hey everyone! 🫠 This week we're back with another release that mostly takes care of some good old fashioned housekeeping. 🧹

So Solidity 0.8.18 was recently released and there are a couple of updates here to keep up with them. The one of the two worth mentioning is the new `block.prevrandao` alias (for `block.difficulty`). This has been added as a globally available variable in the debugger. Additionally, we bumped highlightjs-solidity (which will yield better syntax highlighting) and web3 (woohoo!🎉). We hope you enjoy and we'll see you next time! 👋

      <h2>v5.7.4 — Chocolate bumpy cake (2023-01-27)</h2>
      <pre>Hi all, we've got a small release this week but it's got some useful bug 🐛 fixes!

Specifically, there was a problem where, when using abbreviated names of Truffle commands -- for instance, `truffle migr` instead of `truffle migrate` -- some command-line options might not get set properly.  But this has been fixed now so you may be as terse as you please! 🏎

And -- aside from some internal improvements and dependency updates -- that's it!  But we'll be back next week with more, and interesting things are brewing for later... 🫖

      <pre>Hello all! 👋

We hope you're having a great start to 2023 and hanging in there with your New Year's resolutions. 🧘

This week's release offers up a number of quality of life improvements and all round healthy goodness. Firstly, Truffle now ships with Ganache `v7.7.3` which adds support for the Merge! ♻️ In addition, Truffle now more robustly handles help requests so `truffle help <cmd>`, `truffle <cmd> --help`, and `truffle --help <cmd>` should all have consistent output when searching for help for a given command. 📖 We've also updated the list of supported networks by [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/). 

Lastly, Truffle will also now politely ask if you'll be willing to share telemetry when using [Truffle Dashboard](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/use-the-truffle-dashboard/). 🙏 Note that this will never include any personal data and you can view our [analytics policy](https://trufflesuite.com/analytics/) for more detail. 

That's all for this week, but as always, we'll be back next week with more!

      <pre>Hello all! 👋

We want to bring a delicious chocolate 🍫 pavlova with spiced pears 🍐 to celebrate 🎉 this holiday season. Sit down 🪑, relax 🤗, and enjoy 🥳!!!

While Truffle dropped support for Node 12 a while back, we hadn't been enforcing this in our Node version check at startup.  We now check this; Truffle will now refuse to run on Node 12 to prevent any problems.

One more thing! Please take a moment to complete [The Solidity Development Survey 2022](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/HuPIRv4gvziSV0dPV1SJncKzYJXTVc8LGCaMfLUoj2c/). This helps our community 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 to improve. Thanks! 🙏🏽

      <h2>v5.7.0 — Some treats! (2022-12-15)</h2>
      <pre>Hey ho, we have a release!
Let's go, enjoy it with some treats! 🍫

It's Thursday yet again and we have a Truffle release coming your way! ↔️ This one is pretty exciting because we are finally releasing a console.log for Solidity in Truffle's testing and console environment. Simply use the following import at the top of your contract:

`import "truffle/console.sol";`

Then you can call `console.log()` similar to how you would in JavaScript.

`console.log("this is logging and here is an address - %o", msg.sender);`

Now when you run this code during a Truffle test run or in Truffle's console environment, you will receive logging! Super cool! 🪵

Another change we have this week is an update to the ENS infrastructure. When deploying an ENS dev registry, Truffle will also deploy a reverse registrar to allow for reverse resolution. So happy resolving!

@truffle/provider received a spruce up as well! Remember [EIP 1193](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1193.md)? This is the one that specifies a `request` method on providers (in addition to some other things). Now @truffle/provider is 1193 compliant!

Lastly we have a couple improvements that are a bit more internal to Truffle. A bit of code was cleaned up and fixed 🛠️, and an improvement which makes the encoding of contract creations easier was added.

ℹ️ Oh and before we go, we'd like to once again remind you that the Solidity team is conducting a survey to find ways of bettering the language and the compiler. So go complete it [here](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/HuPIRv4gvziSV0dPV1SJncKzYJXTVc8LGCaMfLUoj2c/) to help improve the ecosystem!

And that should be it for this week! Happy middle of December to everyone and we'll see you again next time!
