      <h2>v0.10.3 Bugfix Release (2024-05-22)</h2>
      <pre>This is a bug fix release for various issues discovered after we released 0.10.2. There are no new major features, just bug fixes. Database files created by DuckDB v0.10.* or v0.9.* can be read by DuckDB v0.10.3.

## Highlights

Even though this is "only" a bug fix release, there have been some major areas of work that warrant a separate mention:
- We have added a feature to update extensions using the `UPDATE EXTENSIONS` syntax #11677
- There have been some serious internal improvements around **checkpointing**, most notably, checkpoints can run while other connections are reading, and no longer block new connections while checkpointing #11918. Also, `FORCE CHECKPOINT`  no longer actively cancels transactions, it now waits until it can checkpoint #12061
- DuckDB now has native support to load data from HuggingFace using the `hf://` prefix #11831
- We have slightly changed `NULL` casting behaviour with the `MAP` type #11745
- The Java JDBC driver has been moved to its own repo: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-java #11873
- DuckDB now cleanly compiles with `-Wconversion` and all conversions are actually being checked #11716, #11673 

## What's Changed
* Add setting to control the maximum swap space by @Tishj in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/10978
* [Python][Dev] Dynamically generate the Connection wrapper methods by @Tishj in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11202
* Fixes duckdb wasm by @carlopi in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11688
* Checked conversions between signed and unsigned integers by @hannes in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11673
* Bump Julia to v0.10.2 by @Mytherin in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11700
* Minor improvements to sql_reduce script by @Mytherin in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11701

      <h2>DuckDB 0.10.0 "Fusca" (2024-02-13)</h2>
      <pre>This release of DuckDB is named "Fusca" after the [Velvet Scooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_scoter) native to Europe.

Note: The on-disk storage format is **backwards-compatible** with the 0.9 releases of DuckDB. For details, please see the [release announcement blog post](https://duckdb.org/2024/02/13/announcing-duckdb-0100.html).

Also note that we've dropped' the "Preview" designation with this release. DuckDB has matured quite a bit since we started creating releases back in 2019, and it is no longer appropriate.

      <h2>0.9.0 Preview Release "Undulata" (2023-09-26)</h2>
      <pre>This preview release of DuckDB is named "Undulata" after the aptly named [Yellow-billed duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_duck) native to Africa.

Note: Again, this release introduces a backwards-incompatible change to the on-disk storage format. We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.

      <h2>0.8.1 Bugfix Release (2023-06-13)</h2>
      <pre>This is a bug fix release for various issues discovered after we released 0.8.0. There are no new features, just bug fixes. Database files created by DuckDB v0.8.0 can be read by DuckDB v0.8.1 (i.e. v0.8.1 is backwards compatible with v0.8.0). Note that database files created by v0.8.1 cannot be read by DuckDB v0.8.0 (i.e. v0.8.0 is not forwards compatible with v0.8.1).

      <h2>0.8.0 Preview Release "Fulvigula" (2023-05-17)</h2>
      <pre>This preview release of DuckDB is named "Fulvigula" after the [Mottled duck (Anas fulvigula)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mottled_duck) which lives in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is apparently highly prized amongst (heartless) hunters. 

There are **two SQL-level breaking changes** in this release: 

- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/7174 The default sort order switched from `NULLS FIRST` to `NULLS LAST` because this is more intuitive, especially in conjunction with `LIMIT`. 
- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/7082 The division operator `/` will now always lead to a floating point result even with integer parameters. The new operator `//` retains the old semantics. This change is consistent with Python. 

Note: Again, this release introduces a backwards-incompatible change to the on-disk storage format. We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.

      <h2>0.7.0 Preview Release "Labradorius" (2023-02-13)</h2>
      <pre>This preview release of DuckDB is named "Labradorius" after the [Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_duck) which was native to North America and went extinct in 1878 despite its reportedly bad taste.

Again, @Mytherin has written a [blog post explaining the exciting list of new features](https://duckdb.org/2023/02/13/announcing-duckdb-070.html) in this release.

Binary builds are listed at the bottom of this post. Please note that it can take a couple of hours until binary builds for all platforms and environments are available.  

Note: Again, this release introduces a backwards-incompatible change to the on-disk storage format. We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.

      <h2>0.6.0 Preview Release "Oxyura" (2022-11-14)</h2>
      <pre>This preview release of DuckDB is named "Oxyura" after the [White-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-headed_duck) which is an endangered species native to Eurasia.

This time, @Mytherin has written a [blog post explaining the quite long and exciting list of new features](https://duckdb.org/2022/11/14/announcing-duckdb-060.html) in this release.

Binary builds are listed at the bottom of this post. Please note that it can take a couple of hours until binary builds for all platforms and environments are available.  

Note: Again, this release introduces a backwards-incompatible change to the on-disk storage format. We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.

      <h2>0.5.0 Preview Release "Pulchellus" (2022-09-05)</h2>
      <pre>This preview release of DuckDB is named "Pulchellus" after the [Green pygmy goose (Nettapus pulchellus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_pygmy_goose) which is native to Australia where [VLDB 2022](https://vldb.org/2022/) is starting today. Despite being called a "goose" it is actually a duck.

Binary builds are listed at the bottom of this post. Feedback is very welcome.

Note: Again, this release introduces a backwards-incompatible change to the on-disk storage format. We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.

Binary builds are listed below. Feedback is very welcome.

Note: This release should be backwards-compatible wrt the on-disk storage format, but the next release may very well be incompatible again. So please don't rely on this just yet.  We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.

Also note: DuckDB is switching to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Version numbers look like this: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with changes to 
 - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
 - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
 - PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

However, note that because `MAJOR` is currently 0, "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable."
