      <pre>2.32.3 (2024-05-29)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed bug breaking the ability to specify custom SSLContexts in sub-classes of
  HTTPAdapter. (#6716)
- Fixed issue where Requests started failing to run on Python versions compiled
  without the `ssl` module. (#6724)</pre>

      <pre>2.32.2 (2024-05-21)
-------------------

**Deprecations**
- To provide a more stable migration for custom HTTPAdapters impacted
  by the CVE changes in 2.32.0, we've renamed `_get_connection` to
  a new public API, `get_connection_with_tls_context`. Existing custom
  HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API.
  `get_connection` is considered deprecated in all versions of Requests>=2.32.0.

  A minimal (2-line) example has been provided in the linked PR to ease
  migration, but we strongly urge users to evaluate if their custom adapter
  is subject to the same issue described in CVE-2024-35195. (#6710)</pre>

-------------------
## üêç PYCON US 2024 EDITION üêç 

**Security**
- Fixed an issue where setting `verify=False` on the first request from a
  Session will cause subsequent requests to the _same origin_ to also ignore
  cert verification, regardless of the value of `verify`.
  (https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56)

**Improvements**
- `verify=True` now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve
  request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should
  also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python
  version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)
- Requests now supports optional use of character detection
  (`chardet` or `charset_normalizer`) when repackaged or vendored.
  This enables `pip` and other projects to minimize their vendoring
  surface area. The `Response.text()` and `apparent_encoding` APIs
  will default to `utf-8` if neither library is present. (#6702)

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly
  calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)
- Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)
- Fixed bug where an extra leading `/` (path separator) could lead
  urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)

**Deprecations**

- Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)
- Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)
- Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)
- Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)

**Documentation**
- Various typo fixes and doc improvements.

**Packaging**
- Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.
  The source files for the projects (formerly `requests`) is now located
  in `src/requests` in the Requests sdist. (#6506)
- Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system
  using `hatchling`. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old
  versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.

      <h2>v2.31.0 (2023-05-22)</h2>
      <pre>2.31.0 (2023-05-22)
-------------------

**Security**
- Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential
  forwarding of `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers when
  following HTTPS redirects.

  When proxies are defined with user info (https://user:pass@proxy:8080), Requests
  will construct a `Proxy-Authorization` header that is attached to the request to
  authenticate with the proxy.

  In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached
  the `Proxy-Authorization` header incorrectly, resulting in the value being
  sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on
  defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade
  to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy
  credentials once the change has been fully deployed.

  Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through
  the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this
  vulnerability.

  Full details can be read in our [Github Security Advisory](https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q)
  and [CVE-2023-32681](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681).</pre>

-------------------

**Dependencies**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Added support for urllib3 2.0. ‚ö†Ô∏è

  This may contain minor breaking changes so we advise careful testing and
  reviewing https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html
  prior to upgrading.

  Users who wish to stay on urllib3 1.x can pin to `urllib3<2`.</pre>

      <pre>2.28.0 (2022-06-09)
-------------------

**Deprecations**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requests has officially dropped support for Python 2.7. ‚ö†Ô∏è (#6091)
- Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.6 (including pypy3). (#6091)

**Improvements**

- Wrap JSON parsing issues in Request's JSONDecodeError for payloads without
  an encoding to make `json()` API consistent. (#6097)
- Parse header components consistently, raising an InvalidHeader error in
  all invalid cases. (#6154)
- Added provisional 3.11 support with current beta build. (#6155)
- Requests got a makeover and we decided to paint it black. (#6095)

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug where setting `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` to an empty string would disable
  cert verification. All Requests 2.x versions before 2.28.0 are affected. (#6074)
- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.SSLError` with
  `requests.exceptions.SSLError` for `content` and `iter_content`. (#6057)
- Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entires caused proxy resolution
  to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry. (#6149)
- Fixed issue where entire payload could be included in the error message for
  JSONDecodeError. (#6079)

      <h2>v2.27.0 (2022-01-06)</h2>
      <pre>2.27.0 (2022-01-03)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- Officially added support for Python 3.10. (#5928)

- Added a `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` to unify JSON exceptions between
  Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the `response.json()` method, and is
  backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.
  Can be caught from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` as well. (#5856)

- Improved error text for misnamed `InvalidSchema` and `MissingSchema`
  exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed
  (Schema->Scheme). (#6017)

- Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address
  recent changes to `urlparse` in Python 3.9+. (#5917)

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed defect in `extract_zipped_paths` which could result in an infinite loop
  for some paths. (#5851)

- Fixed handling for `AttributeError` when calculating length of files obtained
  by `Tarfile.extractfile()`. (#5239)

- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader` with
  `requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader`. (#5914)

- Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (#5391)

- Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where `Proxy-Authorization` was
  incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with `Session.send`. (#5924)

- Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of
  proxies available in the environment. (#5924)

- Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping `UnicodeError` with
  `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the
  domain. (#5414)

**Deprecations**

- Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022. While we
  don't have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be the last release
  series providing support.
