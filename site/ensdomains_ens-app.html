      <h2>Address to domains feature (2019-07-30)</h2>
      <pre>This release adds the graph to get data we couldn't previously get processing events from the front-end. The biggest features is being able to search addresses and get all domains related to that particular address. 

A second more subtle feature is getting subdomains via the graph, so it is much quicker to load subdomains versus processing events. 

The last feature this release adds is storing labels and their hashes into local storage so they can be displayed for unknown hashes. </pre>

      <h2>Refactor to ethers (2019-06-25)</h2>
      <pre>Refactored the UI library to use ethers. It required some subtle changes to the API as ethers had a `.wait()` method on the transaction object. The `sendHelper` was updated to reflect this. Some clean up was done to the utils section so we export the new functions from the `ui` library, and eventually we will remove these when we have time.</pre>

      <h2>Refactor to new labelhash standard (2019-06-05)</h2>
      <pre>Labelhashes are now distinquished with a `[]` around them and added these to the `ui` library that has functions to encode and decode them as well as see if a name contains them. This also means that names that contain them can also be resolved by the manager so names like `jefflau.eth` and `[757d08e156869d4588a90f7a5de7a3e838f63eae3d2e9aa210c92ddd8c937fe5].eth` are equivalent</pre>
