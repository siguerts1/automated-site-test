      <h2>Version 0.8.29 (2025-03-12)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!

We are excited to announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [v0.8.29](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2025/03/12/solidity-0.8.29-release-announcement/).

This latest version of the compiler brings support for EVM Object Format (experimental), Storage Layout Specifiers, and more! 

## Changelog

### Language Features:
 * Allow relocating contract storage to an arbitrary location.


### Compiler Features:
 * Error Reporting: Errors reported during code generation now point at the location of the contract when more fine-grained location is not available.
 * ethdebug: Experimental support for instructions and source locations.

 * Yul: Fix internal compiler error when a code generation error should be reported instead.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix failing debug assertion due to dereferencing of an empty ``optional`` value.


### Build system:
 * Linux release builds are fully static again and no longer depend on ``glibc``.
 * Switch from C++17 to C++20 as the target standard.


### Solc-Js:
 * The wrapper now requires at least nodejs v12.

      <h2>Version 0.8.28 (2024-10-09)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!

We are excited to announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [Solidity v0.8.28](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/10/09/solidity-0.8.28-release-announcement). This is going to be a fairly small release compared to the last one - but an important nonetheless, as we're finally releasing high level language support for transient storage, although at this time, only transient storage state variables of value types are supported. We will of course be working on bringing full support (reference types) in the upcoming releases.

## Changelog

### Language Features:
 * Transient storage state variables of value types are now fully supported.


### Compiler Features:
 * General: Generate JSON representations of Yul ASTs only on demand to reduce memory usage.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Bytecode or IR can now be requested for a subset of all contracts without triggering unnecessary code generation for other contracts.


### Bugfixes:
 * SMTChecker: Fix SMT logic error when assigning to an array of addresses.
 * Yul AST: Fix shifted native source locations when debug info selection included code snippets.


### Build system:
* Removed ``USE_LD_GOLD`` option and default to use the compiler default linker. For custom linkers, ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` can be used.

      <h2>Version 0.8.27 (2024-09-04)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!

We are excited to announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [Solidity v0.8.27](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/09/04/solidity-0.8.27-release-announcement). We've got some exciting new features this time around as well - likely the most anticipated being the support for require with custom errors in the legacy pipeline, which was previously only supported with via IR. On the topic of via IR, we have also made some efficiency improvements with regards to compilation times, namely the caching of already optimized IR, and the re-use thereof. Apart from these, we've also fixed quite a few bugs, added some minor convenience features, and are continuing our work on high-level transient storage support.

## Changelog

### Language Features:
 * Accept declarations of state variables with ``transient`` data location (parser support only, no code generation yet).
 * Make ``require(bool, Error)`` available when using the legacy pipeline.
 * Yul: Parsing rules for source location comments have been relaxed: Whitespace between the location components as well as single-quoted code snippets are now allowed.

### Compiler Features:
 * Commandline Interface: Add ``--transient-storage-layout`` output.
 * Commandline Interface: Allow the use of ``--asm-json`` output option in assembler mode to export EVM assembly of the contracts in JSON format.
 * Commandline Interface: Do not perform IR optimization when only unoptimized IR is requested.
 * Constant Optimizer: Uses ``PUSH0`` if supported by the selected evm version.
 * Error Reporting: Unimplemented features are now properly reported as errors instead of being handled as if they were bugs.
 * EVM: Support for the EVM version "Prague".
 * Peephole Optimizer: ``PUSH0``, when supported, is duplicated explicitly instead of using ``DUP1``.
 * Peephole Optimizer: Remove identical code snippets that terminate the control flow if they occur one after another.
 * SMTChecker: Add CHC engine check for underflow and overflow in unary minus operation.
 * SMTChecker: Replace CVC4 as a possible BMC backend with cvc5.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``transientStorageLayout`` output.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Do not perform IR optimization when only unoptimized IR is requested.
 * Yul: Drop the deprecated typed Yul dialect that was only accessible via ``--yul`` in the CLI.
 * Yul: The presence of types in untyped Yul dialects is now a parser error.
 * Yul Optimizer: Caching of optimized IR to speed up optimization of contracts with bytecode dependencies.
 * Yul Optimizer: The optimizer now treats some previously unrecognized identical literals as identical.

### Bugfixes:
 * Assembler: Fix ICE caused by imprecise calculation of required size of tags in bytecode when code size is above 255.
 * Parser: Fix spuriously emitted parser error for unary plus operations when used as binary operator in some cases.
 * SMTChecker: Fix error that reports invalid number of verified checks for BMC and CHC engines.
 * SMTChecker: Fix formatting of unary minus expressions in invariants.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal compiler error when reporting proved targets for BMC engine.
 * SMTChecker: Fix SMT logic error when assigning to an array of contracts or functions.
 * Standard JSON Interface: For Yul input, properly produce output artifacts in case of warnings.
 * TypeChecker: Fix segfault when assigning nested tuple to tuple.
 * Yul IR Code Generation: Deterministic order of Yul subobjects.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix Yul source locations always referring to unoptimized source, even in optimized outputs.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix warnings being generated twice when there are no errors.
 * Yul Optimizer: Name simplification could lead to forbidden identifiers with a leading and/or trailing dot, e.g., ``x._`` would get simplified into ``x.``.
 * Yul Parser: Fix segfault when parsing very long location comments.

### Build System:
 * Change build system to use git submodules for some dependencies (nlohmann-json, fmtlib & range-v3).

      <h2>Version 0.8.26 (2024-05-21)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!

We are excited to announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [Solidity v0.8.26](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/05/21/solidity-0.8.26-release-announcement). This release brings some exciting new features, namely a much faster default optimizer sequence for the via IR pipeline, which cuts the compilation times significantly. We are introducing usage of `require` functions with custom errors, at this time for the via IR pipeline only, in addition to an optimization for reverting with errors of small static encoding sizes, which should now have lower gas costs. As always, there are multiple small bugfixes to go with the release.

## Changelog

### Language Features:
 * Introduce a new overload ``require(bool, Error)`` that allows usage of ``require`` functions with custom errors. This feature is available in the ``via-ir`` pipeline only.

### Compiler Features:
 * SMTChecker: Create balance check verification target for CHC engine.
 * Yul IR Code Generation: Cheaper code for reverting with errors of a small static encoding size.
 * Yul Optimizer: New, faster default optimizer step sequence.

### Bugfixes:
 * Commandline Interface: Fix ICE when the optimizer is disabled and an empty/blank string is used for ``--yul-optimizations`` sequence.
 * SMTChecker: Fix false positive when comparing hashes of same array or string literals.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on mapping access caused by too strong requirements on sort compatibility of the index and mapping domain.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using an empty tuple in a conditional operator.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using bitwise operators with an array element as argument.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Fix ICE when the optimizer is disabled and an empty/blank string is used for ``optimizerSteps`` sequence.
 * StaticAnalyzer: Only raise a compile time error for division and modulo by zero when it's between literals.
 * TypeChecker: Fix compiler crash when the left-hand side of an assignment was a parenthesized non-tuple expression of a tuple type.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix optimizer executing each repeating part of the step sequence at least twice, even if the code size already became stable after the first iteration.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix the order of assignments generated by ``SSATransform`` being dependent on AST IDs, sometimes resulting in different (but equivalent) bytecode when unrelated files were added to the compilation pipeline.

### Build System:
* Replace internal JSON library jsoncpp with nlohmann::json.

      <h2>Version 0.8.25 (2024-03-14)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!

We are excited to announce the release of the Solidity Compiler [Solidity v0.8.25](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/03/14/solidity-0.8.25-release-announcement). This release is a small one, and is mainly centered around the Dencun hard-fork that occurred yesterday. On that note, the default EVM version in the compiler is now ``cancun``, and we've also introduced some gas savings via better exploitation of the ``MCOPY`` opcode, as well fixing an issue that could result in larger than necessary bytecode.

## Changelog

### Compiler Features:
 * Code Generator: Use ``MCOPY`` instead of ``MLOAD``/``MSTORE`` loop when copying byte arrays.
 * EVM: Set default EVM version to ``cancun``.
 * Yul Analyzer: Emit transient storage warning only for the first occurrence of ``tstore``.


### Bugfixes:
 * Assembler: Prevent incorrect calculation of tag sizes.
 * Commandline Interface: Do not run IR pipeline when ``--via-ir`` is used but no output that depends on the IR is requested.
 * EVM Assembly Import: Fix handling of missing source locations during import.
 * SMTChecker: Ensure query is properly flushed to a file before calling solver when using SMT-LIB interface.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by not respecting the sign of an integer type when constructing zero-value SMT expressions.
 * SMTChecker: Run Eldarica only when explicitly requested with `--model-checker-solvers eld`, even when it is present on the system.

      <h2>Version 0.8.22 (2023-10-25)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!
We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.22](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/10/25/solidity-0.8.22-release-announcement).

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
This release deprecates support for EVM versions older than Constantinople for the reason of ruling out the need to maintain multiple complex code paths or workarounds for ancient EVM versions. In case you rely on the support for such EVM versions, please reach out to us.

Notable Features:

* Unchecked loop increments
* Adding support for importing EVM Assembly JSON (experimental)
* Adjusting Yul optimizer to rematerialize zero literals

### Changelog

Language Features:

 * Allow defining events at file level.

Compiler Features:

* Code Generator: Remove redundant overflow checks of certain `for` loops when the counter variable cannot overflow.
* Commandline Interface: Add `--no-import-callback` option that prevents the compiler from loading source files not given explicitly on the CLI or in Standard JSON input.
* Commandline Interface: Add an experimental `--import-asm-json` option that can import EVM assembly in the format used by `--asm-json`.
* Commandline Interface: Use proper severity and coloring also for error messages produced outside of the compilation pipeline.
* EVM: Deprecate support for "homestead", "tangerineWhistle", "spuriousDragon" and "byzantium" EVM versions.
* Parser: Remove the experimental error recovery mode (`--error-recovery` / `settings.parserErrorRecovery`).
* SMTChecker: Support user-defined operators.
* Yul Optimizer: If `PUSH0` is supported, favor zero literals over storing zero values in variables.
* Yul Optimizer: Run the `Rematerializer` and `UnusedPruner` steps at the end of the default clean-up sequence.

Bugfixes:

* Code Generator: Fix output from via-IR code generator being dependent on which files were discovered by import callback. In some cases, a different AST ID assignment would alter the order of functions in internal dispatch, resulting in superficially different but semantically equivalent bytecode.
* NatSpec: Fix internal error when requesting `userdoc` or `devdoc` for a contract that emits an event defined in a foreign contract or interface.
* SMTChecker: Fix encoding error that causes loops to unroll after completion.
* SMTChecker: Fix inconsistency on constant condition checks when `while` or `for` loops are unrolled before the condition check.
* Yul Optimizer: Fix replacement decisions during CSE being affected by Yul variable names generated by the compiler, resulting in different (but equivalent) bytecode in some situations.
 
 AST Changes:

 * AST: Fix wrong initial ID for Yul nodes in the AST.

      <h2>Version 0.8.21 (2023-07-19)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!
We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.21](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/07/19/solidity-0.8.21-release-announcement/). 

### Changelog

Important Bugfixes:
 * Code Generator: Always generate code for the expression in ``<expression>.selector`` in the legacy code generation pipeline.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step (``i``) not preserving the evaluation order of arguments passed into inlined functions in code that is not in expression-split form (i.e. when using a custom optimizer sequence in which the step not preceded by ``ExpressionSplitter`` (``x``)).


Language Features:
 * Allow qualified access to events from other contracts.
 * Relax restrictions on initialization of immutable variables. Reads and writes may now happen at any point at construction time outside of functions and modifiers. Explicit initialization is no longer mandatory.


Compiler Features:
 * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ast-compact-json`` output in assembler mode.
 * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ir-ast-json`` and ``--ir-optimized-ast-json`` outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.
 * Commandline Interface: Respect ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` in compiler mode and accept them in assembler mode as well. ``--optimize --no-optimize-yul`` combination now allows enabling EVM assembly optimizer without enabling Yul optimizer.
 * EWasm: Remove EWasm backend.
 * Parser: Introduce ``pragma experimental solidity``, which will enable an experimental language mode that, in particular, has no stability guarantees between non-breaking releases and is not suited for production use.
 * SMTChecker: Add ``--model-checker-print-query`` CLI option and ``settings.modelChecker.printQuery`` JSON option to output the SMTChecker queries in the SMTLIB2 format. This requires using ``smtlib2`` solver only.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``ast`` file-level output for Yul input.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``irAst`` and ``irOptimizedAst`` contract-level outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.
 * Yul Optimizer: Remove experimental ``ReasoningBasedSimplifier`` optimization step.
 * Yul Optimizer: Stack-to-memory mover is now enabled by default whenever possible for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.


Bugfixes:
 * Code Generator: Disallow complex expressions whose results are types, built-ins, modules or some unassignable functions. The legacy code generation pipeline would not actually evaluate them, discarding any side effects they might have.
 * Code Generator: Fix not entirely deterministic order of functions in unoptimized Yul output. The choice of C++ compiler in some cases would result in different (but equivalent) bytecode (especially from native binaries vs emscripten binaries).
 * Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using ``--stop-after parsing`` and requesting some of the outputs that require full analysis or compilation.
 * Commandline Interface: It is no longer possible to specify both ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` at the same time.
 * SMTChecker: Fix encoding of side-effects inside ``if`` and ``ternary conditional``statements in the BMC engine.
 * SMTChecker: Fix false negative when a verification target can be violated only by a trusted external call from another public function.
 * SMTChecker: Fix generation of invalid SMT-LIB2 scripts in BMC engine with trusted mode for external calls when CHC engine times out.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by incorrectly classifying external function call using function pointer as a public getter.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by using external identifier to encode member access to functions that take an internal function as a parameter.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Fix an incomplete AST being returned when analysis is interrupted by certain kinds of fatal errors.
 * Type Checker: Disallow using certain unassignable function types in complex expressions.
 * Type Checker: Function declaration types referring to different declarations are no longer convertible to each other.
 * Yul Optimizer: Ensure that the assignment of memory slots for variables moved to memory does not depend on AST IDs that may depend on whether additional files are included during compilation.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step not ignoring code that is not in expression-split form.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix optimized IR being unnecessarily passed through the Yul optimizer again before bytecode generation.


AST Changes:
 * AST: Add the ``experimentalSolidity`` field to the ``SourceUnit`` nodes, which indicates whether the experimental parsing mode has been enabled via ``pragma experimental solidity``.

      <h2>Version 0.8.20 (2023-05-10)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!
We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.20](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/). 
This latest version includes a range of improvements and, most importantly, support for Shanghai!
It also contains performance improvements in the via-IR pipeline and improves the list of events exposed in the contract ABI.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This compiler switches the **default** target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include ``PUSH0`` opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not yet support ``PUSH0``, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

### Changelog

**Compiler Features:**
 * Assembler: Use ``push0`` for placing ``0`` on the stack for EVM versions starting from "Shanghai". This decreases the deployment and runtime costs.
 * EVM: Set default EVM version to "Shanghai".
 * EVM: Support for the EVM Version "Shanghai".
 * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``enum`` definitions.
 * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``struct`` definitions.
 * NatSpec: Include NatSpec from events that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it in userdoc and devdoc output.
 * Optimizer: Re-implement simplified version of ``UnusedAssignEliminator`` and ``UnusedStoreEliminator``. It can correctly remove some unused assignments in deeply nested loops that were ignored by the old version.
 * Parser: Unary plus is no longer recognized as a unary operator in the AST and triggers an error at the parsing stage (rather than later during the analysis).
 * SMTChecker: Group all messages about unsupported language features in a single warning. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-unsupported`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showUnsupported`` can be enabled to show the full list.
 * SMTChecker: Properties that are proved safe are now reported explicitly at the end of analysis. By default, only the number of safe properties is shown. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-proved-safe`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showProvedSafe`` can be enabled to show the full list of safe properties.
 * Standard JSON Interface: Add experimental support for importing ASTs via Standard JSON.
 * Yul EVM Code Transform: If available, use ``push0`` instead of ``codesize`` to produce an arbitrary value on stack in order to create equal stack heights between branches.


**Bugfixes:**
 * ABI: Include events in the ABI that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it.
 * Immutables: Disallow initialization of immutables in try/catch statements.
 * SMTChecker: Fix false positives in ternary operators that contain verification targets in its branches, directly or indirectly.


**AST Changes:**
 * AST: Add the ``internalFunctionIDs`` field to the AST nodes of contracts containing IDs of functions that may be called via the internal dispatch. The field is a map from function AST IDs to internal dispatch function IDs. These IDs are always generated, but they are only used in via-IR code generation.
 * AST: Add the ``usedEvents`` field to ``ContractDefinition`` which contains the AST IDs of all events emitted by the contract as well as all events defined and inherited by the contract.

      <h2>Version 0.8.19 (2023-02-22)</h2>
      <pre>Introducing the newest version of the Solidity Compiler!
We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.19](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/02/22/solidity-0.8.19-release-announcement/). 
This latest version includes a range of improvements and, most importantly, [custom operators for user-defined value types](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/02/22/user-defined-operators) language feature!
It also contains a fix for a long-standing bug that can result in code that is only used in creation code to also be included in runtime bytecode.

### Changelog
**Language Features:**
* Allow defining custom operators for user-defined value types via ``using {f as +} for T global`` syntax.


**Compiler Features:**
 * SMTChecker: New trusted mode that assumes that any compile-time available code is the actual used code, even in external calls. This can be used via the CLI option ``--model-checker-ext-calls trusted`` or the JSON field ``settings.modelChecker.extCalls: "trusted"``.


**Bugfixes:**
 * Assembler: Avoid duplicating subassembly bytecode where possible.
 * Code Generator: Avoid including references to the deployed label of referenced functions if they are called right away.
 * ContractLevelChecker: Properly distinguish the case of missing base constructor arguments from having an unimplemented base function.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by unhandled ``z3`` expressions that come from the solver when bitwise operators are used.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using the custom NatSpec annotation to abstract free functions.
 * TypeChecker: Also allow external library functions in ``using for``.


**AST Changes:**
 * AST: Add ``function`` field to ``UnaryOperation`` and ``BinaryOperation`` AST nodes. ``functionList`` in ``UsingForDirective`` AST nodes will now contain ``operator`` and ``definition`` members instead of ``function`` when the list entry defines an operator.

This latest version includes a range of improvements and it also introduces support for the [Paris upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement)!


### Changelog
**Language Features:**
 * Allow named parameters in mapping types.


**Compiler Features:**
 * Commandline Interface: Add ``--no-cbor-metadata`` that skips CBOR metadata from getting appended at the end of the bytecode.
 * Commandline Interface: Return exit code ``2`` on uncaught exceptions.
 * EVM: Deprecate ``block.difficulty`` and disallow ``difficulty()`` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= paris. The change is due to the renaming introduced by [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399).
 * EVM: Introduce ``block.prevrandao`` in Solidity and ``prevrandao()`` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= paris.
 * EVM: Set the default EVM version to "Paris".
 * EVM: Support for the EVM version "Paris".
 * Language Server: Add basic document hover support.
 * Natspec: Add event Natspec inheritance for devdoc.
 * Optimizer: Added optimization rule ``and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z)) => shl(X, and(Y, Z))``.
 * Parser: More detailed error messages about invalid version pragmas.
 * SMTChecker: Make ``z3`` the default solver for the BMC and CHC engines instead of all solvers.
 * SMTChecker: Support Eldarica as a Horn solver for the CHC engine when using the CLI option ``--model-checker-solvers eld``. The binary ``eld`` must be available in the system.
 * Solidity Upgrade Tool: Remove ``solidity-upgrade`` tool.
 * Standard JSON: Add a boolean field ``settings.metadata.appendCBOR`` that skips CBOR metadata from getting appended at the end of the bytecode.
 * TypeChecker: Warn when using deprecated builtin ``selfdestruct``.
 * Yul EVM Code Transform: Generate more optimal code for user-defined functions that always terminate a transaction. No return labels will be pushed for calls to functions that always terminate.
 * Yul Optimizer: Allow replacing the previously hard-coded cleanup sequence by specifying custom steps after a colon delimiter (``:``) in the sequence string.
 * Yul Optimizer: Eliminate ``keccak256`` calls if the value was already calculated by a previous call and can be reused.


**Bugfixes:**
 * Parser: Disallow several ``indexed`` attributes for the same event parameter.
 * Parser: Disallow usage of the ``indexed`` attribute for modifier parameters.
 * SMTChecker: Fix display error for negative integers that are one more than powers of two.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on chain assignments using static fully specified state variables.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on multiple wrong SMTChecker natspec entries.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when a public library function is called internally.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when deleting struct member of function type.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using user-defined types as mapping indices or struct members.
 * SMTChecker: Improved readability for large integers that are powers of two or almost powers of two in error messages.
 * TypeChecker: Fix bug where private library functions could be attached with ``using for`` outside of their declaration scope.
 * Yul Optimizer: Hash hex and decimal literals according to their value instead of their representation, improving the detection of equivalent functions.

**UPDATE 2023-02-02**: The Linux binary originally included here has been rebuilt and replaced due to incompatibility with older Ubuntu releases (Bionic, Focal and earlier). We have recently migrated our CI builds to Ubuntu 22.04, which includes a backwards-incompatible glibc version. Since the Linux binary is not completely static (it dynamically loads Z3 and consequently glibc), it would not run with older glibc when built against newer one. You can find [more details in the release blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement/#update-2023-02-02-rebuilt-linux-binary-for-solidity-0818) and issue #13921.

To be clear: both binaries will produce identical outputs under all circumstances, including the commit hash in the metadata. Only the hash of the compiler binary itself will change due to the replacement, but the new binary will always produce byte-identical output.

The SHA-256 hash of the old binary was `a1c0f33eb4482c26f56719ecf62b0ee05d7d7a4f8264ffbddf9ebcd9095c32bd`. The new one is
`95e6ed4949a63ad89afb443ecba1fb8302dd2860ee5e9baace3e674a0f48aa77`.</pre>

For details, please see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement/).

**Important Bugfixes:**
 * Code Generation: Avoid writing dirty bytes to storage when copying ``bytes`` arrays.
 * Yul Optimizer: Keep all memory side-effects of inline assembly blocks.


**Language Features:**
 * Add `E.selector` for a non-anonymous event `E` to access the 32-byte selector topic.


**Compiler Features:**
 * LSP: Add rudimentary support for semantic highlighting.
 * Type Checker: Warn about assignments involving multiple pushes to storage ``bytes`` that may invalidate references.
 * Yul Optimizer: Improve inlining heuristics for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.


**Bugfixes:**
 * ABI Encoder: When encoding an empty string coming from storage do not add a superfluous empty slot for data.
 * Common Subexpression Eliminator: Process assembly items in chunks with maximum size of 2000. It helps to avoid extremely time-consuming searches during code optimization.
 * Yul Optimizer: Do not remove ``returndatacopy`` in cases in which it might perform out-of-bounds reads that unconditionally revert as out-of-gas. Previously, any 
``returndatacopy`` that wrote to memory that was never read from was removed without accounting for the out-of-bounds condition.

      <h2>Version 0.8.13 (2022-03-16)</h2>
      <pre>Solidity v0.8.13 fixes an important bug related to ``abi.encodeCall``, extends the ``using for`` directive and implements "go to definition" for the language server.

Furthermore, compiling via the new Yul IR pipeline is now considered production ready.

For more details, see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/03/16/solidity-0.8.13-release-announcement/).

**Important Bugfixes:**
 * Code Generator: Correctly encode literals used in ``abi.encodeCall`` in place of fixed bytes arguments.


**Language Features:**
 * General: Allow annotating inline assembly as memory-safe to allow optimizations and stack limit evasion that rely on respecting Solidity's memory model.
 * General: ``using M for Type;`` is allowed at file level and ``M`` can now also be a brace-enclosed list of free functions or library functions.
 * General: ``using ... for T global;`` is allowed at file level where the user-defined type ``T`` has been defined, resulting in the effect of the statement being available everywhere ``T`` is available.


**Compiler Features:**
 * Commandline Interface: Allow the use of ``--via-ir`` in place of ``--experimental-via-ir``.
 * Compilation via Yul IR is no longer marked as experimental.
 * JSON-AST: Added selector field for errors and events.
 * LSP: Implements goto-definition.
 * Peephole Optimizer: Optimize comparisons in front of conditional jumps and conditional jumps across a single unconditional jump.
 * Yul EVM Code Transform: Avoid unnecessary ``pop``s on terminating control flow.
 * Yul Optimizer: Remove ``sstore`` and ``mstore`` operations that are never read from.


**Bugfixes:**
 * General: Fix internal error for locales with unusual capitalization rules. Locale set in the environment is now completely ignored.
 * Type Checker: Fix incorrect type checker errors when importing overloaded functions.
 * Yul IR Code Generation: Optimize embedded creation code with correct settings. This fixes potential mismatches between the constructor code of a contract compiled in isolation and the bytecode in ``type(C).creationCode``, resp. the bytecode used for ``new C(...)``.

**Language Features:**
 * General: Add equality-comparison operators for external function types.
 * General: Support ``ContractName.functionName`` for ``abi.encodeCall``, in addition to external function pointers.


**Compiler Features:**
 * Commandline Interface: Event and error signatures are also returned when using ``--hashes``.
 * Yul Optimizer: Remove ``mstore`` and ``sstore`` operations if the slot already contains the same value.

 * Code Generator: Fix internal error when doing an explicit conversion from ``string calldata`` to ``bytes``.
 * Control Flow Graph: Perform proper virtual lookup for modifiers for uninitialized variable and unreachable code analysis.
 * General: ``string.concat`` now properly takes strings as arguments and returns ``string memory``. It was accidentally introduced as a copy of ``bytes.concat`` before.
 * Immutables: Fix wrong error when the constructor of a base contract uses ``return`` and the derived contract contains immutable variables.
 * Inheritance: Consider functions in all ancestors during override analysis.
 * IR Generator: Add missing cleanup during the conversion of fixed bytes types to smaller fixed bytes types.
 * IR Generator: Add missing cleanup for indexed event arguments of value type.

 * IR Generator: Fix IR syntax error when copying storage arrays of structs containing functions.
 * Natspec: Fix internal error when overriding a struct getter with a Natspec-documented return value and the name in the struct is different.
 * Type Checker: Fix internal error when a constant variable declaration forward references a struct.
 * Yul EVM Code Transform: Improved stack shuffling in corner cases.


**Solc-Js:**
 * The wrapper now requires at least nodejs v10.
 * The code has been ported to TypeScript.


**Build System:**
 * Emscripten builds store the embedded WebAssembly binary in LZ4 compressed format and transparently decompress on loading.

      <h2>Version 0.8.8 (2021-09-27)</h2>
      <pre>Solidity v0.8.8 introduces user defined value types as a major feature, improves overriding interface functions and reading from immutables. Apart from bugfixes, we also cleaned up the command-line interface and improved the way the
import mechanism resolves files.

For more details, see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/09/27/solidity-0.8.8-release-announcement/).

**Language Features:**
 * Inheritance: A function that overrides only a single interface function does not require the ``override`` specifier.
 * Type System: Support ``type(E).min`` and ``type(E).max`` for enums.
 * User Defined Value Type: allows creating a zero cost abstraction over a value type with stricter type requirements.

**Compiler Features:**
 * Commandline Interface: Add ``--include-path`` option for specifying extra directories that may contain importable code (e.g. packaged third-party libraries).
 * Commandline Interface: Do not implicitly run evm bytecode generation unless needed for the requested output.
 * Commandline Interface: Normalize paths specified on the command line and make them relative for files located inside base path and/or include paths.
 * Immutable variables can be read at construction time once they are initialized.
 * SMTChecker: Add constraints to better correlate ``address(this).balance`` and ``msg.value``.
 * SMTChecker: Support constants via modules.
 * SMTChecker: Support low level ``call`` as external calls to unknown code.
 * SMTChecker: Support the ``value`` option for external function calls.
 * SMTChecker: Support user defined value types.

**Bugfixes:**
 * Code Generator: Fix ICE on assigning to calldata structs and statically-sized calldata arrays in inline assembly.
 * Code Generator: Use stable source order for ABI functions.
 * Commandline Interface: Disallow the ``--experimental-via-ir`` option in Standard JSON, Assembler and Linker modes.
 * Commandline Interface: Fix resolution of paths whitelisted with ``--allowed-paths`` or implicitly due to base path, remappings and files being compiled. Correctly handle paths that do not match imports exactly due to being relative, non-normalized or empty.
 * Commandline Interface: Report optimizer options as invalid in Standard JSON and linker modes instead of ignoring them.
 * Name Resolver: Fix that when importing an aliased symbol using ``import {AliasedName} from "a.sol"`` it would use the original name of the symbol and not the aliased one.
 * Opcode Optimizer: Prevent the optimizer from running multiple times to avoid potential bytecode differences for referenced code.
 * Parser: Properly check for multiple SPDX license identifiers next to each other and validate them.
 * SMTChecker: Fix BMC's constraints regarding internal functions.
 * SMTChecker: Fix false negative caused by ``push`` on storage array references returned by internal functions.
 * SMTChecker: Fix false positive in external calls from constructors.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on some multi-source uses of ``abi.*``, cryptographic functions and constants.
 * Standard JSON: Fix non-fatal errors in Yul mode being discarded if followed by a fatal error.
 * Type Checker: Correct wrong error message in inline assembly complaining about ``.slot`` or ``.offset` not valid when actually ``.length`` was used.
 * Type Checker: Disallow modifier declarations and definitions in interfaces.
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix a crash in LoadResolver, when ``keccak256`` has particular non-identifier arguments.

      <pre>Solidity v0.8.7 introduces support for the [London upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/07/15/london-mainnet-announcement/), includes
various improvements to Yul to EVM code transformation, the SMTChecker and some bugfixes.

For more details, see [the release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/08/11/solidity-0.8.7-release-announcement/).

**Language Features:**
 * Introduce global ``block.basefee`` for retrieving the base fee of the current block.
 * Yul: Introduce builtin ``basefee()`` for retrieving the base fee of the current block.


**Compiler Features:**
 * AssemblyStack: Also run opcode-based optimizer when compiling Yul code.
 * Commandline Interface: option ``--pretty-json`` works also with ``--standard--json``.
 * EVM: Set the default EVM version to "London".
 * SMTChecker: Do not check underflow and overflow by default.

 * Yul EVM Code Transform: Do not reuse stack slots that immediately become unreachable.
 * Yul Optimizer: Move function arguments and return variables to memory with the experimental Stack Limit Evader (which is not enabled by default).


**Bugfixes:**
 * Code Generator: Fix crash when passing an empty string literal to ``bytes.concat()``.
 * Code Generator: Fix internal compiler error when calling functions bound to calldata structs and arrays.
 * Code Generator: Fix internal compiler error when passing a 32-byte hex literal or a zero literal to ``bytes.concat()`` by disallowing such literals.

      <h2>Version 0.8.6 (2021-06-22)</h2>
      <pre>Solidity 0.8.6 fixes some non-critical but annoying bugs, especially a warning about unreachable code that
is in fact reachable.

For more details, please see the [release announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/06/22/solidity-0.8.6-release-announcement/).

**Language Features:**
 * Yul: Special meaning of ``".metadata"`` data object in Yul object.

**Bugfixes:**
 * Control Flow Graph: Fix incorrectly reported unreachable code.
 * Solc-Js: When running ``solcjs`` without the ``--optimize`` flag, use ``settings.optimizer.enabled=false`` in Standard JSON instead of omitting the key.
 * Standard JSON: Omitting ``settings.optimizer.enabled`` was not equivalent to setting it to ``false``. It meant disabling also the peephole optimizer and jumpdest remover which by default still run with ``enabled=false``.

      <h2>Version 0.8.0 (2020-12-16)</h2>
      <pre>Solidity 0.8.0 is a breaking release of the Solidity compiler and language. 

For a detailed explanation of the new features and changes, please see the [blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/12/16/solidity-v0.8.0-release-announcement/).

### Breaking Changes:
* Code Generator: All arithmetic is checked by default. These checks can be disabled using ``unchecked { ... }``.
* Code Generator: Cause a panic if a byte array in storage is accessed whose length is encoded incorrectly.
* Code Generator: Use ``revert`` with error signature ``Panic(uint256)`` and error codes instead of invalid opcode on failing assertions.
* Command Line Interface: JSON fields `abi`, `devdoc`, `userdoc` and `storage-layout` are now sub-objects rather than strings.
* Command Line Interface: Remove the ``--old-reporter`` option.
* Command Line Interface: Remove the legacy ``--ast-json`` option. Only the ``--ast-compact-json`` option is supported now.
* General: Enable ABI coder v2 by default.
* General: Remove global functions ``log0``, ``log1``, ``log2``, ``log3`` and ``log4``.
* Parser: Exponentiation is right associative. ``a**b**c`` is parsed as ``a**(b**c)``.
* Scanner: Remove support for the ``\b``, ``\f``, and ``\v`` escape sequences.
* Standard JSON: Remove the ``legacyAST`` option.
* Type Checker: Function call options can only be given once.
* Type System: Declarations with the name ``this``, ``super`` and ``_`` are disallowed, with the exception of public functions and events.
* Type System: Disallow ``msg.data`` in ``receive()`` function.
* Type System: Disallow ``type(super)``.
* Type System: Disallow enums with more than 256 members.
* Type System: Disallow explicit conversions from negative literals and literals larger than ``type(uint160).max`` to ``address`` type.
* Type System: Disallow the ``byte`` type. It was an alias to ``bytes1``.
* Type System: Explicit conversion to ``address`` type always returns a non-payable ``address`` type. In particular, ``address(u)``, ``address(b)``, ``address(c)`` and ``address(this)`` have the type ``address`` instead of ``address payable`` (Here ``u``, ``b``, and ``c`` are arbitrary variables of type ``uint160``, ``bytes20`` and contract type respectively.)
* Type System: Explicit conversions between two types are disallowed if it changes more than one of sign, width or kind at the same time.
* Type System: Explicit conversions from literals to enums are only allowed if the value fits in the enum.
* Type System: Explicit conversions from literals to integer type is as strict as implicit conversions.
* Type System: Introduce ``address(...).code`` to retrieve the code as ``bytes memory``. The size can be obtained via ``address(...).code.length``, but it will currently always include copying the code.
* Type System: Introduce ``block.chainid`` for retrieving the current chain id.
* Type System: Support ``address(...).codehash`` to retrieve the codehash of an account.
* Type System: The global variables ``tx.origin`` and ``msg.sender`` have type ``address`` instead of ``address payable``.
* Type System: Unary negation can only be used on signed integers, not on unsigned integers.
* View Pure Checker: Mark ``chainid`` as view.
* Yul: Disallow the use of reserved identifiers, such as EVM instructions, even if they are not available in the given dialect / EVM version.
* Yul: The ``assignimmutable`` builtin in the "EVM with objects" dialect takes the base offset of the code to modify as an additional argument.

### Language Features:
* Super constructors can now be called using the member notation e.g. ``M.C(123)``.

### Bugfixes:
* Type Checker: Perform proper truncating integer arithmetic when using constants in array length expressions.

### AST Changes:
* New AST Node ``IdentifierPath`` replacing in many places the ``UserDefinedTypeName``.
* New AST Node ``UncheckedBlock`` used for ``unchecked { ... }``.
