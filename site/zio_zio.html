  <h1>ðŸš€ zio/zio - Release Notes</h1>
  
    <section>
      <h2>2.1.16 (2025-02-26)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights
This seemingly small release brings 2 new features to ZIO which library authors can utilize in order to provide a better DX for users. As usually, it also contains a number of optimizations, bug fixes, and it's fully binary and source-compatible with the rest of the v2.x series.

### `HasNoScope` evidence (https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/9604)

In ZIO, having a `Scope` as an environment requirement indicates that the effect contains finalizers (e.g., closing an HTTP connection) which need to be handled at some point in the evaluation of the effect or the application's lifetime. In certain cases, we might want to ensure that an effect provided to a method does not contain any finalizers. Starting with this version of ZIO, users / library authors can use the `HasNoScope` evidence for methods where the environment is generic, e.g.,:

```scala
def foo[R, A](f: ZIO[R, Nothing, A)(using HasNoScope[R]) = ???

val f1 = foo(ZIO.succeed("foo")) // compiles
val f2 = foo(ZIO.acquireRelease(ZIO.succeed("foo"))(_ => ZIO.unit)) // fails to compile
```

Note that this feature is primarily intended for use in libraries such as `zio-http` where we need to ensure that a user-provided effect does not contain any finalizers.

### Generic interfaces for non-empty collections (https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/9560)

This release introduces the `NonEmptySeq` type class (which `NonEmptyChunk` now extends) so that users / library authors can write generic code which requires non-empty collections as arguments.

      <h2>2.1.15 (2025-02-05)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This release contains various under-the-hood optimizations and minor bug fixes.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> One noteable change is the update of `izumi-reflect` to v3.x from v2.x. This version of `izumi-reflect` generates tags that are not binary/backwards compatible for Scala 3 opaque types with those generated by v2.x.
>
> Since `zio` itself does not use opaque types, we considered this as a safe change. However, library authors that have ZIO as a dependency might want to check whether this change affects them in any way and release a new version using the updated `zio` / `izumi-reflect` versions

      <pre>## Highlights

This release comes packed with bug fixes and under-the-hood optimizations. Big thank you to all the old and new contributors for their work in this release!

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> ### Runtime behaviour change of `ZIO#onDone` and `ZIO#onDoneCause`
> In this release, the behavior of `onDone` and `onDoneCause` has changed to address concerns raised in https://github.com/zio/zio/issues/9191. Unlike other `onX` methods, `onDone` and `onDoneCause` executed the callback effects in "fire and forget" mode.
> 
> We believe that this behaviour could lead to unexpected bugs in applications. As such we changed the implementation of these methods so that the callbacks are executed synchronously. While we believe it's highly unlikely that users using these methods were aware of this implementation detail, we still advice them to review their usages as a precaution.

      <h2>2.1.13 (2024-11-20)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights
This seemingly small release brings a number of new features and important bugfixes:
1. Adds support for the Junit 5 engine via the new `zio-test-junit-engine` module #9214.
2. [ScalaJS] Adds support for accessing environment variables via `zio.System` in JS engines that support it (e.g., NodeJS) #9282.
3. Fixes a bug to an issue some users faced with `ZStream.mapZIOPar*` methods since v2.1.12 #9312.

As always, this version is fully source and binary compatible with the rest of the v2.x series.

      <h2>2.1.10 (2024-10-10)</h2>
      <pre>This release brings a few important bug fixes related to `ZPool` and `ZSTM` as well as some optimizations. It also fixes a binary incompatibility that caused runtime errors when using an older version ZIO Streams together with ZIO 2.1.9.

### Important note about ZPool changes

There are 2 fixes / changes to ZPool that might affect the behaviour of an application so users are advised to revise the following in cases of unexpected behaviour after upgrading to ZIO 2.1.10+.

#### Eager / strict initialization of ZPool's resources

In previous ZIO versions, the initialization of ZPool resources was done lazily in a daemon fiber. e.g., this code would previously print the message, but will now "hang" awaiting for the pool to be initialized to its full size:

```scala
ZPool.make(ZIO.never, 10) *> ZIO.debug("Pool initialized")
```

We believe that this change makes the behaviour of ZPool more predictable (and referentially transparent!) as previously there were no guarantees that the ZPool resources would be initialized during the creation of the pool. However, this might result in the initialization of the pool hanging in cases that the acquisition of the resources itself hangs. Therefore users are advised to consider adding timeouts to the resource initialization effect.

#### Strict finalization of ZPool resources

In previous versions, it was possible for the ZPool finalizers to be interrupted, which would lead to potential leak of resources (see [this issue](https://github.com/zio/zio/issues/9152) for more info). Starting with ZIO 2.1.10+, closing a ZPool requires all of the resource finalizers to finish first. As with (1), this might lead to some unexpected behaviour if the finalization of a resource hangs indefinitely, so users are advised to add timeouts to the finalizers of resources used with ZPool.

## What's Changed
* Use "unsafe" methods in `Ref.Atomic` by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/9155
* Fix ZPool finalizers not running when resource acquisition fails or is interrupted by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/9163
* Initialize ZPool to its full size in the calling fiber by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/9164
* Install signal handlers when running test suites by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/9166

      <h2>2.1.8 (2024-08-24)</h2>
      <pre>This release brings a re-implemented ZSTM runtime that significantly improves performance under contention, enables multi-threading for Scala Native 0.5.x, squashes some minor bugs, and makes a few things run a little bit faster. And it is fully binary and source-compatible with the rest of 2.x release!
 
## Highlights

### ZSTM performance improvements

The performance of ZSTM under heavy contention has regressed over time due to various bug fixes. In this release, we reimplemented the internal runtime of ZSTM in order to significantly improve its performance under heavy contention (up to 800% improved throughput in some benchmarks!) all while achieving similar or better performance under no contention. For more details check out #9081

### Scala Native multi-threading support

In the previous release, we updated Scala Native to v0.5.x but as we mentioned in the release notes, the ZIO runtime was not yet multi-threading capable. In this release, we threw most of the existing Scala Native code (which was not thread-safe) and changed it to use (mostly) the same code as the JVM artifacts. Users that currently use ZIO with Scala Native 0.5.x must enable multi-threading for Scala Native in their builds by removing `nativeConfig ~= { _.withMultithreading(false) }`.

> [!WARNING]
> We're aware of an issue when using `zio-test` on MacOS ARM64 when the `debug` compilation mode is used (default).  If you come across any issues, try setting the `mode` to `releaseFast` or `releaseFull` (see [here](https://github.com/zio/zio/blob/9b657286e28ee8effbc9ae6e0c443a02a783c083/project/BuildHelper.scala#L246-L251) for an example)

      <h2>2.1.7 (2024-08-05)</h2>
      <pre>This release adds support for Scala Native 0.5, contains various bug fixes as well as performance optimizations.

## Highlights

### Scala Native 0.5 support

This version of ZIO is released using Scala Native 0.5, which means that libraries that depend on ZIO can now also update their Scala Native version. Special thanks to @sideeffffect for his work on this ðŸŽ‰ 

> [!WARNING]
> At the moment, ZIO is not yet fully compatible for use with Scala Native's multi-threading feature. We are planning on [adding support for it soon](https://github.com/zio/zio/issues/9056), but until then, users are encouraged to disable it using `nativeConfig ~= { _.withMultithreading(false) }` in their project config.

### Fix memory leaks in parallel `ZStream` processing methods

In v2.1.3 we did a number of optimizations to parallel ZStream processing. Unfortunately, since then we received a number of reports where users experienced memory leaks, which we managed to trace back to these optimizations. While we managed to patch a number of these issues in subsequent releases, we weren't able to fully eliminate them and therefor we made the decision to temporarily revert them back to their pre-v2.1.3 implementation. We are planning be revisiting optimizations for these methods in a future release but this time ensuring that they don't lead to memory leaks for edge-case usage patterns.

> [!TIP]  
> Based on the reports we received, it appears that many users use unbounded parallelism (i.e., `n = Int.MaxValue`) in `ZStream`'s `*Par` methods. To improve performance of these methods, we highly encourage users the following:
> * Use a finite parallelism limit for ZStream's`*Par` methods. The limit needs to make sense for the workflow and system's resources. If unsure on what value to use, you can use these values as a vague starting point:
> i. CPU-bounded workflow: `n = nCPU`
> ii. IO-bounded: workflow `n = nCPU x ~8-16`
> * If overriding the buffer size, use a relatively small value (i.e., `<= 16`)
> * Use a power of 2 value for both parallelism and buffer sizes

      <h2>2.1.5 (2024-06-28)</h2>
      <pre>This minor release contains a bug fix and a few improvements. The most meaningful improvement is that we now try to detect when an asynchronous effect is run from inside another ZIO effect via `Runtime.unsafe.run` (which is an anti-pattern! but happens in the wild) and move it automatically to the blocking threadpool to prevent deadlocks.

## What's Changed
* Cleanup `submit` and `submitAndYield` methods in `ZScheduler` by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8957
* Avoid deadlocks when a Fiber is unsafely running asynchronous effects by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8955

      <h2>2.1.3 (2024-06-12)</h2>
      <pre>This minor release contains an important fix to a regression introduced in v2.1.2, where `ZEnvironment#prune` throws an error in cases where a class implements multiple services. This regression is most likely to be observed during `ZLayer` composition during app initialization, but users that have updated to v2.1.2 are still advised to update to v2.1.3 as soon as possible.

In addition, this release also contains performance improvements to `ZStream` and `Chunk`, as well as some minor bug fixes.

      <h2>2.1.2 (2024-06-04)</h2>
      <pre>This minor release contains various bug fixes, performance improvements and quality of life improvements.

One notable addition is a new runtime flag called `EagerShiftBack` to force shifting back to the default executor immediately after running a blocking computation (currently it stays on the blocking threadpool until the next yield or the fiber terminates). It is disabled by default so there is no change in behavior compared to older versions.

      <h2>2.1.1 (2024-05-11)</h2>
      <pre>We found a couple bugs in 2.1.0 so this we decided to release a patch version quickly:
- An application using ZIO metrics would hang forever when receiving the termination signal after interrupting all other fibers. This is because `ScopedRef` now runs acquisition in an uninterruptibe region. You might want to be careful if you use `ZLayer.reloadable` and its variants: fibers forked in those layers are need to be marked as `interruptible` explicitly.
- ZIO test assertions were broken on Scala.js with Scala 2.12 because of unsupported reflection usage.

## What's Changed
* Add a TestAspect to run tests in the blocking threadpool by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8835
* Fix metrics causing the application to hang on termination by @ghostdogpr in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8837

      <h2>2.1.0 (2024-05-09)</h2>
      <pre>This version brings a lot of performance improvements in the fiber runtime as well as the scheduler. It is fully binary compatible with the 2.0.x branch with the exception of some internal classes that shouldn't be used anywhere else (we tested a wide range of the library ecosystem without issues).

An important change is that we disabled auto-blocking detection by default because it could cause some performance degradation in some cases. Better heuristics might be introduced in the future, but in the meantime you can enable it by using the `Runtime.enableAutoBlockingExecutor` aspect. We also added an optional executor based on Loom that you can use if your Java version is 21 or higher with the `Runtime.enableLoomBasedExecutor` aspect. Which one is better may vary based on your use case so we encourage you to test and measure it.

If you use sttp v3 and Scala 3, you might run into a compile error when trying to provide or access `SttpClient` from/to your environment. This is because since https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8612 we don't allow materializing tags for intersection types in covariant position and sttp does exactly that: `type SttpClient = SttpBackend[Task, ZioStreams with WebSockets]`. Using `SttpBackend[Task, Any]` or only one of `ZioStreams`/`WebSockets` solves the issue.

      <pre>This version contains a few more performance improvements as well as some changes to maintain binary compatibility with ZIO 2.0.x so that there is no need to upgrade all libraries using ZIO. It is expected to be the last release candidate: if no major issues are discovered, we are planning to release a final 2.1.0 in about a week. Please report if you find anything!

      <h2>2.1.0-RC3 (2024-04-20)</h2>
      <pre>We found a regression in [2.1.0-RC2](https://github.com/zio/zio/releases/tag/v2.1.0-RC2) causing compile errors with `ZLayer.make` or `ZIO#provide`. The change causing these errors has been reverted and we're making a RC3 right away so that more people can test the recent runtime improvements.

## What's Changed
* Revert "Build fresh layers once with ZLayer macro (#8678)" by @ghostdogpr in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8768

    <section>
      <h2>2.1.0-RC2 (2024-04-19)</h2>
      <pre>This release candidate builds on the previous [ZIO runtime system improvements](https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8582) delivered in the [2.1-RC1](https://github.com/zio/zio/releases/tag/v2.1-RC1) to add [major improvements in forking and joining fibers](https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8745). Our `ForkJoin` benchmark is about 6x faster than in 2.0.x, and close to 20x faster when you disable `FiberRoots` (which is recommended for high performance).

We've also changed the default behavior to disable auto-blocking detection by default because it could cause some performance degradation in some cases. Better heuristics might be introduced in the future, but in the meantime you can enable it by using the `Runtime.enableAutoBlockingExecutor` aspect. We also added an optional executor based on Loom that you can use if your Java version is 21 or higher. It looks like our default `ZScheduler` is faster when forking a lot of fibers, but depending on your use case, you might want to try this new executor using the `Runtime.enableLoomBasedExecutor` aspect.

Because of the amount of changes, we decided to release a new release candidate first, and hope to get people to test it and report any issue. We will probably do a minor RC3 with a few fixes but are hoping to release 2.1.0 soon. Note that this version is binary compatible with 2.0.x with the exception of a few internal classes that should not be used anywhere else, but if you find any incompatibility issue, please let us know.

      <h2>2.0.22 (2024-04-12)</h2>
      <pre>This release contains a few performance improvements that were backported to the 2.0.x branch so you can benefit from them sooner (the "current" branch is for 2.1.x, for which a RC2 will probably be released in the coming weeks). These changes, in particular the `FiberRuntime` one, have shown a ~10-15% improvement in some benchmarks.

* `FiberRuntime` optimizations by @kyri-petrou in https://github.com/zio/zio/pull/8672
