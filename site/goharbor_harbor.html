## Known issue
- [known issue #20412](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20412) Harbor supports only one signature for each artifact been replicated to destination Harbor which is signed by legacy cosign. If you want to replicated multiple signatures for a subject image,  please using oci-1.1 mode(cosign v2.2.1+) for signing.
- [known issue #20565](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20565) Issue with SBOM generation in Harbor v2.11.0 when using external Reverse Proxy (HTTP 404)
- [known issue #20691](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20691) LDAP handshake failure with LDAP server has old TLS_RSA_* cipher suites. Workaround: add env variable GODEBUG="tlsrsakex=1"  to common/config/core/env file and restart Harbor.
## Tips
 - [Best practice](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Harbor-FAQs#notation-signature-accessory) for image singing with [Notation v1.2.0 ](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.2.0-alpha.1) in Harbor 

## What's Changed
### Exciting New Features üéâ
#### SBOM Generation and Management
 Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.
> When `Automatically generate SBOM on push` is enabled and there are massive concurrent push to that project, users may need to enable asynchronously updating project quota by setting `core.quotaUpdateProvider: redis` (values.yaml for harbor-helm) or setting [core.quota_update_provider: redis](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/v2.11.0/make/harbor.yml.tmpl#L316) (`harbor.yml` for installation via docker-compose) so that it can reduce the overall resource consumption, like db connection, cpu usage and memory usage.

#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 üéâ
Harbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)

#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry

## Known issue
- [known issue #20056](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20056) requires a user to be a member of a project in the source (GitLab) registry when doing pull-based replication from GitLab registry to Harbor registry. Even if it is a public project in GitLab registry, a user has to be a member of that project and then performs replication. Affected versions are v2.10.x, v2.9.x.

## What's Changed
### Exciting New Features üéâ
#### SBOM Generation and Management:
 Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.

#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 üéâ
Harbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)

#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry: 
Users can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.

#### Korean UI Translation: 
The user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.

## Known issue
- [known issue #20056](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20056) requires a user to be a member of a project in the source (GitLab) registry when doing pull-based replication from GitLab registry to Harbor registry. Even if it is a public project in GitLab registry, a user has to be a member of that project and then performs replication. Affected versions are v2.10.x, v2.9.x.

## What's Changed
### Exciting New Features üéâ
#### SBOM Generation and Management:
 Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.

#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 üéâ
Harbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)

#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry: 
Users can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.

#### Korean UI Translation: 
The user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.

## Known issue
- [known issue #20056](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20056) requires a user to be a member of a project in the source (GitLab) registry when doing pull-based replication from GitLab registry to Harbor registry. Even if it is a public project in GitLab registry, a user has to be a member of that project and then performs replication. Affected versions are v2.10.x, v2.9.x.

## What's Changed
### Exciting New Features üéâ
#### SBOM Generation and Management:
 Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.

#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 üéâ
Harbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)

#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry: 
  Users can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.

#### Korean UI Translation: 
  The user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.
