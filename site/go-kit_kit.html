      <h2>v0.11.0 (2021-07-04)</h2>
      <pre>A new release with several improvements and enhancements. The first one in a long while! Huge thanks to @sagikazarmark for putting in most of the gruntwork to make it happen! You're a superstar.

The biggest thing: package log has been extracted to a separate repository and module, [go-kit/log](https://github.com/go-kit/log). This means that if you or your project was importing go-kit/kit just to get package log, you can significantly reduce your go.mod and dep graph by switching to the new module. Note that we have no current plans to alias the existing go-kit/kit/log to the new go-kit/log module and package, nor to deprecate the current package in favor of the new one. They are two distinct packages with no defined relationship to each other. This may change in the future.

Major changes:

- The log package was extracted to a [separate repository](https://github.com/go-kit/log)
- Examples were moved to a separate [repository](https://github.com/go-kit/examples)
- Deprecated kitgen was removed

      <h2>v0.10.0 (2020-02-17)</h2>
      <pre>A new release with several minor improvements and enhancements. The major change is the adoption of Go modules: Go kit now includes a go.mod (and go.sum) specifying the precise version of our dependencies. We'll try to keep these dependencies updated, but consumers can always specify overrides, if necessary.

      <h2>0.5.0 (2017-06-20)</h2>
      <pre>A pre-GopherCon release, the biggest change being **breaking changes to package sd**. We now expose the raw instance strings from each underlying service discovery system, so that consumers can do things with them other than construct endpoints. For background, see issues #475, #403, and #209, and for the (extensive) discussion, see PR #492.

Besides that, we just have a solid set of improvements and enhancements. See below for the full changelog. Huge thanks to Yuri Shkuro @yurishkuro for his tireless work on package sd, including dealing with my mercurial demands and frustratingly irregular schedule. And huge thanks to the 17 individual contributors who've contributed to this release! üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- log: Update NewSyncWriter to work with term.IsTerminal (#501) ‚Äî thanks, @ChrisHines

      <h2>0.4.0 (2017-03-08)</h2>
      <pre>Another substantial Go kit release, with a handful of bugfixes and some major enhancements.

We now use stdlib package context wherever possible ‚Äî basically, everywhere except package transport/grpc, as gRPC still imports golang.org/x/net/context and we don't have a choice but to comply. Still, there are ways to bridge the gap: see examples/addsvc for details. This means **Go kit now requires Go 1.7 or above**.

The other major changes in this release involve package log. We've **removed NewContext and the Context type**, preferring [With](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/log#With) and [WithPrefix](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/log#WithPrefix) helper functions. Also, we've promoted the experiemental level package to **[package level](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/log/level)**, and deprecated the old levels package to deprecated_levels. I'm really happy with this: it's a slightly esoteric, but really clean and literate way to compose levels with Go kit's package log. Give it a shot!

For the full changelog, see below. My enormous gratitude goes to Chris Hines @ChrisHines for his expert work on package log, and to Bas van Beek @basvanbeek for his expert work on packages tracing and transport/grpc. And huge thanks to the 22 individual contributors who've contributed to this release! üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
