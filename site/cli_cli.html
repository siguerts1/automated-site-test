      <h2>GitHub CLI 2.67.0 (2025-02-11)</h2>
      <pre>## Security

A bug in `gh attestation verify` may return an incorrect zero exit status when no matching attestations are found for the specified `--predicate-type <value>` or the default `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1` if not specified. This issue only arises if an artifact has an attestation with a predicate type different from the one provided in the command. As a result, users relying solely on these exit codes may mistakenly believe the attestation has been verified, despite the absence of an attestation with the specified predicate type and the tool printing a verification failure.

Users are advised to update gh to version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible.

For more information, see https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-fgw4-v983-mgp8

## `gh pr checkout` now supports interactively selecting a pull request

Similar to commands like `gh workflow run` which prompts for a workflow to run, now `gh pr checkout` will prompt for a pull request to checkout. The list is currently limited to the most recent 10 pull requests in the repository.

Big thank you to @nilvng for implementing this üôå 

## Contributing guidelines updated

We've updated our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to give more clarity around old `help wanted` issues.

_TLDR_:

- Please directly mention `@cli/code-reviewers` when an issue you want to work on does not have clear Acceptance Criteria
- Please only open pull requests for issues with _both_  the help wanted label and clear Acceptance Criteria
- Please avoid expanding pull request scope to include changes that are not described in the connected issue's Acceptance Criteria

Note: Acceptance Criteria is posted as an issue comment by a core maintainer. 

See https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/10381 and https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/10395 for more information.


‚ùì Have feedback on anything? We'd love to hear from you in a discussion post ‚ù§Ô∏è

      <pre>## Hotfix: `gh pr view` fails with provided URL

This addresses a regression in `gh pr view` was reported in #10352. This regression was due to a change in `v2.66.0` that no longer allowed `gh pr` subcommands to execute properly outside of a git repo.

## What's Changed

- Hotfix: `gh pr view` fails with provided URL by @jtmcg in https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/10354

      <pre>## `gh pr view` and `gh pr status` now respect common triangular workflow configurations

Previously, `gh pr view` and `gh pr status` would fail for pull request's (PR) open in triangular workflows. This was due to `gh` being unable to identify the PR's corresponding remote and branch refs on GitHub. 

Now, `gh pr view` and `gh pr status` should successfully identify the PR's refs when the following common git configurations are used:

- [`branch.<branchName>.pushremote`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-branchltnamegtpushRemote) is set
- [`remote.pushDefault`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-remotepushDefault) is set

Branch specific configuration, the former, supersedes repo specific configuration, the latter. 

Additionally, if the [`@{push}` revision syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions#Documentation/gitrevisions.txt-emltbranchnamegtpushemegemmasterpushemempushem) for git resolves for a branch, `gh pr view` and `gh pr status` should work regardless of additional config settings.

For more information, see

- https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/9364
- https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/9365
- https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/9374

## `gh secret list`, `gh secret set`, and `gh secret delete` now require repository selection when multiple `git` remotes are present

Previously, `gh secret list`, `gh secret set`, and `gh secret delete` would determine which remote to target for interacting with GitHub Actions secrets.  Remotes marked as default using `gh repo set-default` or through other `gh` commands had higher priority when figuring out which repository to interact with.  This could have unexpected outcomes when using `gh secret` commands with forked repositories as the upstream repository would generally be selected.

Now, `gh secret` commands require users to disambiguate which repository should be the target if multiple remotes are present and the `-R, --repo` flag is not provided.

For more information, see https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/4688

## Extension update notices now notify once every 24 hours per extension and can be disabled

Previously, the GitHub CLI would notify users about newer versions every time an extension was executed.  This did not match GitHub CLI notices, which only notified users once every 24 hours and could be disabled through an environment variable.

Now, extension update notices will behave similar to GitHub CLI notices.  To disable extension update notices, set the `GH_NO_EXTENSION_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` environment variable.

## Security

- A security vulnerability has been identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokens when cloning repositories containing git submodules hosted outside of GitHub.com and ghe.com.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/cli/cli/compare/v2.61.0...v2.62.0

## Security

- A security vulnerability has been identified in GitHub CLI that could allow remote code execution (RCE) when users connect to a malicious Codespace SSH server and use the `gh codespace ssh` or `gh codespace logs` commands. 

  For more information, see https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-p2h2-3vg9-4p87

## GitHub CLI notifies users about latest extension upgrades

Similar to the notification of latest `gh` releases, the `v2.62.0` version of GitHub CLI will notify users about latest extension upgrades when the extension is used:

```shell
$ gh ado2gh
...

A new release of ado2gh is available: 1.7.0 ‚Üí 1.8.0
To upgrade, run: gh extension upgrade ado2gh --force
https://github.com/github/gh-ado2gh
```

### Why does this matter?

This removes a common pain point of extension authors as they have had to reverse engineer and implement a similar mechanism within their extensions directly.

With this quality of life improvement, there are 2 big benefits:

1. Extension authors will hopefully see increased adoption of newer releases while having lower bar to maintaining their extensions.
2. GitHub CLI users will have greater awareness of new features, bug fixes, and security fixes to the extensions used.

### What do you need to do?

Extension authors should review their extensions and consider removing any custom logic previously implemented to notify users of new releases.</pre>

      <pre>## Ensure users understand consequences before making repository visibility changes

In `v2.61.0`, `gh repo edit` command has been enhanced to inform users about [consequences of changing visibility](https://gh.io/setting-repository-visibility) and ensure users are intentional before making irreversible changes:

1. Interactive `gh repo edit` visibility change requires confirmation when changing from `public`, `private`, or `internal`
1. Non-interactive `gh repo edit --visibility` change requires new `--accept-visibility-change-consequences` flag to confirm 
1. New content to inform users of consequences
   - Incorporate [GitHub Docs content](https://gh.io/setting-repository-visibility) into help usage and interactive `gh repo edit` experience
   - Expanded help usage to call out most concerning consequences
   - Display repository star and watcher counts to understand impact before confirming

      <h2>GitHub CLI 2.49.0 (2024-04-30)</h2>
      <pre>## Support for GitHub Artifact Attestations

`v2.49.0` release introduces the `attestation` command set for downloading and verifying attestations about artifacts built in GitHub Actions! This is part of the larger Artifact Attestations initiative. An artifact attestation is a piece of cryptographically signed metadata that is generated as part of your artifact build process. These attestations bind artifacts to the details of the workflow run that produced them, and allow you to guarantee the integrity and provenance of any artifact built in GitHub Actions.

```shell
# Verify a local artifact
gh attestation verify artifact.bin -o <your org>

# Verify a local artifact against a local artifact attestation
gh attestation verify artifact.bin -b ./artifact-v0.0.1-bundle.json -o <your org>

# Verify an OCI image
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/foo/bar:latest -o <your org>

# Download artifact attestations
gh attestation download artifact.bin -o <your org>
```

To get started, check out gh help attestation. You can also use the `gh at <command>` alias for short.
