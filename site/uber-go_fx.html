  <h1>ðŸš€ uber-go/fx - Release Notes</h1>
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.23.0 (2024-10-11)</h2>
      <pre>### Added

  a constructor or a decorator that's run, including functions created
  by `fx.Supply` and `fx.Replace`.

### Changed
- Overhauled the documentation website. (https://uber-go.github.io/fx/)</pre>

      <pre>### Fixed
- A deadlock with the relayer in signal receivers.

### Changed
- Upgrade Dig dependency to v1.18.0</pre>

    <section>
      <h2>v1.22.1 (2024-06-25)</h2>
      <pre>### Fixed
- Fx apps will only listen to signals when `.Run()`, `.Wait()`, or `.Done()`
  are called, fixing a regression introduced in v1.19.0.

Thank you @MarcoPolo for your contribution to the release.</pre>

    <section>
      <h2>v1.22.0 (2024-05-30)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- Add `fx.Self` which can be passed to the `fx.As` annotation to signify
  that a type should be provided as itself.
- Add `fxtest.EnforceTimeout` that can be passed to `fxtest.NewLifecycle`
  to force `Start` and `Stop` to return context errors when hook context expires.

### Changed
- `fx.Private` can now be used with `fx.Supply`.

### Fixed
- Fx apps will no longer listen to OS signals when they are stopped,
  solving blocking issues in programs that depended on OS signals
  after an Fx app stops.

Thank you @MarcoPolo for your contribution to the release.</pre>

    <section>
      <h2>v1.19.0 (2023-01-04)</h2>
      <pre>
### Added
- `fx.RecoverFromPanics` Option which allows Fx to recover from user-provided constructors
  and invoked functions.
- `fx.Private` that allows the constructor to limit the scope of its outputs to the wrapping
  `fx.Module`.
- `ExitCode` ShutdownOption which allows setting custom exit code at the end of app
  lifecycle.
- `Wait` which returns a channel that can be used for waiting on application shutdown.
- fxevent/ZapLogger now exposes `UseLogLevel` and `UseErrorLevel` methods to set
  the level of the Zap logs produced by it.
- Add lifecycle hook-convertible methods: `StartHook`, `StopHook`, `StartStopHook`
  that can be used with more function signatures.

### Changed
- `fx.WithLogger` can now be passed at `fx.Module` level, setting custom logger at
  `Module` scope instead of the whole `App`.

### Fixed
- `fx.OnStart` and `fx.OnStop` Annotations now work with annotated types that was
  provided by the annotated constructor.
- fxevent/ZapLogger: Errors from `fx.Supply` are now logged at `Error` level, not
  `Info`.
- A race condition in lifecycle Start/Stop methods.
- Typos in docs.

- A new fxevent.Replaced event written to fxevent.Logger following an fx.Replace.

## Fixed
- Upgrade Dig dependency to v1.14.1 to address a couple of issues with decorations. Refer to Dig v1.14.1 release notes for more details.
- fx.WithLogger no longer ignores decorations and replacements of types that it depends on.

- App.Start and App.Stop no longer deadlock if the OnStart/OnStop hook exits the current goroutine.

## Changed

      <pre>### Added
- Add `fx.Annotate` to allow users to provide parameter and result tags easily without

  interface(s) that they implement instead of the types themselves.

### Fixed

    <section>
      <h2>v1.14.2 (2021-08-16)</h2>
      <pre>### Changed
- For fxevent console implementation: no longer log non-error case for fxevent.Invoke event, while for zap implementation, start logging fx.Invoking case without stack.</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.14.1 (2021-08-16)</h2>
      <pre>### Changed

    <section>
      <h2>v1.14.0 (2021-08-12)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- Introduce the new `fx.WithLogger` option. Provide a constructor for
  `fxevent.Logger` objects with it to customize how Fx logs events.
- Add new `fxevent` package that exposes events from Fx in a structured way.
  Use this to write custom logger implementations for use with the
  `fx.WithLogger` option.
- Expose and log additional information when lifecycle hooks time out.

### Changed
- Fx now emits structured JSON logs by default. These may be parsed and
  processed by log ingestion systems.
- `fxtest.Lifecycle` now logs to the provided `testing.TB` instead of stderr.
- `fx.In` and `fx.Out` are now type aliases instead of structs.</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>v1.13.1 (2020-08-19)</h2>
      <pre>### Fixed
- Fix minimum version constraint for dig. `fx.ValidateGraph` requires at least
  dig 1.10.</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.13.0 (2020-06-16)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- Added `fx.ValidateGraph` which allows graph cycle validation and dependency correctness
 without running anything. This is useful if `fx.Invoke` has side effects, does I/O, etc.
</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.12.0 (2020-04-09)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- Added `fx.Supply` to provide externally created values to Fx containers
  without building anonymous constructors.

### Changed
- Drop library dependency on development tools.
</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.11.0 (2020-04-01)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- Value groups can use the `flatten` option to indicate values in a slice should
  be provided individually rather than providing the slice itself. See package
  documentation for details.</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.10.0 (2019-11-20)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- All `fx.Option`s now include readable string representations.
- Report stack traces when `fx.Provide` and `fx.Invoke` calls fail. This
  should make these errors more debuggable.

### Changed
- Migrated to Go modules.
</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.9.0 (2019-01-22)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- Add the ability to shutdown Fx applications from inside the container. See
  the Shutdowner documentation for details.
- Add `fx.Annotated` to allow users to provide named values without creating a
  new constructor.
</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.8.0 (2018-11-06)</h2>
      <pre>### Added
- Provide DOT graph of dependencies in the container.</pre>
    </section>
    <hr />
  
    <section>
      <h2>v1.7.1 (2018-09-26)</h2>
      <pre>### Fixed
- Make `fxtest.New` ensure that the app was created successfully. Previously,
  it would return the app (similar to `fx.New`, which expects the user to verify
  the error).
- Update dig container to defer acyclic validation until after Invoke. Application
  startup time should improve proportional to the size of the dependency graph.
- Fix a goroutine leak in `fxtest.Lifecycle`.</pre>
