* chore: require go v1.22 by @canstand in https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/pull/489
* fix: Panics caused by BoundingBox API returning nil by @GuyGoldenberg in https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/pull/498

* feat: remove hardcoded subdirectories to RunOptions.DriverDirectory by @canstand in https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/pull/501

## BREAKING CHANGE
* When specifying the playwright driver directory via `RunOptions.DriverDirectory` or the `PLAYWRIGHT_DRIVER_PATH` environment variable, you need to point directly to the directory of the corresponding version. The previously hard-coded `ms-playwright-go/x.xx.x` subdirectory is now only applies to the default cache directory. (close https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/issues/496)
* require go v1.22

      <h2>v0.3700.0 (2023-08-30)</h2>
      <pre>This version is on pair driver-wise with the Playwright 1.37 version.

## BREAKING CHANGE: 
Due to the rewrite of the go code generation scripts, it brings a lot of changes. 
Note the following 4 types:

1. Links and **Deprecated** tags in Go doc comments now work.
   - May cause many **Deprecated** lint errors, please update the call or use `//nolint:staticcheck` to ignore.
1. Added event interface methods. For example `WebSocket.OnFrameReceived()` etc. 
    ```go
    // before
    websocket.On("framereceived", ...)
    // after
    websocket.OnFrameReceived(...)
    ```
1. The signatures of some interface methods have changed, for example:
   - Unified optional parameter naming. For example, previously all `Click` used `PageClickOptions`, now
      ```go
      Locator.Click(options ...LocatorClickOptions)
      Page.Click(selector string, options ...PageClickOptions)
      Frame.Click(selector string, options ...FrameClickOptions)
      ```
   - Some parameters are generated as new types or names, e.g. `Page.AddInitScript(script Script)`
1. Removed several methods that were not documented upstream. These methods can be safely converted to other existing methods.  For example
   - `Page.ExpectedDialog` can use `Page.OnDialog` instead.
   - All `xxxAssertions.NotTo...`, use `.Not().xxx` pls.
   - `WebSocket.On("framesent", ...)`, use `WebSocket.OnFrameSent(...)`.

The release would not have been possible without @canstand, thanks a ton to him! üíØ 

### Breaking change:

Locators now return no error anymore.

```go
// before
l, err := page.Locator("body")
assertNil(t, err)
d, err := l.Locator("div")
assertNil(t, err)
// ...

// after
_, err := page.Locator("body").Locator("div").And("p").TextContent()
assertNil(t, err)

### Breaking change:

You need to either install the driver+browsers via CLI or via the API. It does not happen automatically anymore.

Via the CLI:

```bash
go run github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/cmd/playwright install
# Or
go install github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/cmd/playwright
playwright install --with-deps
```

```go
err := playwright.Install()
