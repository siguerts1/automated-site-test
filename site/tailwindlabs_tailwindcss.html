Holy shit it's actually done â€” we just tagged Tailwind CSS v4.0.

Tailwind CSS v4.0 is an all-new version of the framework optimized for performance and flexibility, with a reimagined configuration and customization experience, and taking full advantage of the latest advancements the web platform has to offer.

- [New high-performance engine](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#new-high-performance-engine) â€” where full builds are up to 5x faster, and incremental builds are over 100x faster â€” and measured in microseconds.
- [Designed for the modern web](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#designed-for-the-modern-web) â€” built on cutting-edge CSS features like cascade layers, registered custom properties with `@property`, and `color-mix()`.
- [Simplified installation](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#simplified-installation) â€” fewer dependencies, zero configuration, and just a single line of code in your CSS file.
- [First-party Vite plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#first-party-vite-plugin) â€” tight integration for maximum performance and minimum configuration.
- [Automatic content detection](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#automatic-content-detection) â€” all of your template files are discovered automatically, with no configuration required.
- [Built-in import support](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#built-in-import-support) â€” no additional tooling necessary to bundle multiple CSS files.
- [CSS-first configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#css-first-configuration) â€” a reimagined developer experience where you customize and extend the framework directly in CSS instead of a JavaScript configuration file.
- [CSS theme variables](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#css-theme-variables) â€” all of your design tokens exposed as native CSS variables so you can access them anywhere.
- [Dynamic utility values and variants](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#dynamic-utility-values-and-variants) â€” stop guessing what values exist in your spacing scale, or extending your configuration for things like basic data attributes.
- [Modernized P3 color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#modernized-p3-color-palette) â€” a redesigned, more vivid color palette that takes full advantage of modern display technology.
- [Container queries](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#container-queries) â€” first-class APIs for styling elements based on their container size, no plugins required.
- [New 3D transform utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#new-3d-transform-utilities) â€” transform elements in 3D space directly in your HTML.
- [Expanded gradient APIs](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#expanded-gradient-apis) â€” radial and conic gradients, interpolation modes, and more.
- [@starting-style support](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#starting-style-support) â€” a new variant you can use to create enter and exit transitions, without the need for JavaScript.
- [not-* variant](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#not-variant) â€” style an element only when it doesn't match another variant, custom selector, or media or feature query.
- [Even more new utilities and variants](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#even-more-new-utilities-and-variants) â€” including support for `color-scheme`, `field-sizing`, complex shadows, `inert`, and more.

Start using Tailwind CSS v4.0 today by [installing it in a new project](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/), or playing with it directly in the browser on [Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/).

For existing projects, we've published a comprehensive [upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) and built an [automated upgrade tool](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#using-the-upgrade-tool) to get you on the latest version as quickly and painlessly as possible.
