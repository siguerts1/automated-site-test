      <h2>Version 0.28.0 (2024-11-28)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.28.0 (28th November, 2024)

The 0.28 release includes a limited set of deprecations.

**Deprecations**:

We are working towards a simplified SSL configuration API.

*For users of the standard `verify=True` or `verify=False` cases, or `verify=<ssl_context>` case this should require no changes. The following cases have been deprecated...*

* The `verify` argument as a string argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.
* The `cert` argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.

Our revised [SSL documentation](docs/advanced/ssl.md) covers how to implement the same behaviour with a more constrained API.

**The following changes are also included**:

* The deprecated `proxies` argument has now been removed.
* The deprecated `app` argument has now been removed.
* JSON request bodies use a compact representation. (#3363)
* Review URL percent escape sets, based on WHATWG spec. (#3371, #3373)
* Ensure `certifi` and `httpcore` are only imported if required. (#3377)
* Treat `socks5h` as a valid proxy scheme. (#3178)
* Cleanup `Request()` method signature in line with `client.request()` and `httpx.request()`. (#3378)
* Bugfix: When passing `params={}`, always strictly update rather than merge with an existing querystring. (#3364)</pre>

      <h2>Version 0.26.0 (2023-12-20)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.26.0 (20th December, 2023)

### Added

* The `proxy` argument was added. You should use the `proxy` argument instead of the deprecated `proxies`, or use `mounts=` for more complex configurations. (#2879)

### Deprecated

* The `proxies` argument is now deprecated. It will still continue to work, but it will be removed in the future. (#2879)

### Fixed

      <h2>Version 0.24.1 (2023-05-18)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.24.1 (17th May, 2023)

    <section>
      <h2>Version 0.24.0 (2023-04-11)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.24.0 (6th April, 2023)

### Changed

* The logging behaviour has been change to be more in-line with other standard Python logging usages. We no longer have a custom `TRACE` log level, and we no longer use the `HTTPX_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to auto-configure logging. We now have a significant amount of `DEBUG` logging available at the network level. Full documentation is available at https://www.python-httpx.org/logging/ (#2547, encode/httpcore#648)
* The `Response.iter_lines()` method now matches the stdlib behaviour and does not include the newline characters. It also resolves a performance issue. (#2423)
* Query parameter encoding switches from using + for spaces and %2F for forward slash, to instead using %20 for spaces and treating forward slash as a safe, unescaped character. This differs from `requests`, but is in line with browser behavior in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Both options are RFC valid. (#2543)
* NetRC authentication is no longer automatically handled, but is instead supported by an explicit `httpx.NetRCAuth()` authentication class. See the documentation at https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#netrc-support (#2525)

### Removed

* The `rfc3986` dependancy has been removed. (#2252)</pre>

      <h2>Version 0.23.3 (2023-01-04)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.23.3 (4th Jan, 2023)

### Fixed

* Version 0.23.2 accidentally included stricter type checking on query parameters. This shouldn've have been included in a minor version bump, and is now reverted. (#2523, #2539)</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Version 0.23.2 (2023-01-02)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.23.2 (2nd Jan, 2023)

 ### Added

 * Support digest auth nonce counting to avoid multiple auth requests. (#2463)

 ### Fixed

 * Multipart file uploads where the file length cannot be determine now use chunked transfer encoding, rather than loading the entire file into memory in order to determine the `Content-Length`. (#2382)
 * Raise `TypeError` if content is passed a dict-instance. (#2495)
 * Partially revert the API breaking change in 0.23.1, which removed `RawURL`. We continue to expose a `url.raw` property which is now a plain named-tuple. This API is still expected to be deprecated, but we will do so with a major version bump. (#2481)</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Version 0.23.1 (2022-11-18)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.23.1

### Added

* Support for Python 3.11. (#2420)
* Allow setting an explicit multipart boundary in `Content-Type` header. (#2278)
* Allow `tuple` or `list` for multipart values, not just `list`. (#2355)
* Allow `str` content for multipart upload files. (#2400)
* Support connection upgrades. See https://www.encode.io/httpcore/extensions/#upgrade-requests

### Fixed

* Don't drop empty query parameters. (#2354)

### Removed

* Drop `.read`/`.aread` from SyncByteStream/AsyncByteStream (#2407)
* Drop `RawURL`. (#2241)</pre>

      <h2>Version 0.23.0 (2022-05-23)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.23.0 (23rd May, 2022)

 ### Changed

 * Drop support for Python 3.6. (#2097)
 * Use `utf-8` as the default character set, instead of falling back to `charset-normalizer` for auto-detection. To enable automatic character set detection, see [the documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#character-set-encodings-and-auto-detection). (#2165)

 ### Fixed

 * Fix `URL.copy_with` for some oddly formed URL cases. (#2185)
 * Digest authentication should use case-insensitive comparison for determining which algorithm is being used. (#2204)
 * Fix console markup escaping in command line client. (#1866)
 * When files are used in multipart upload, ensure we always seek to the start of the file. (#2065)
 * Ensure that `iter_bytes` never yields zero-length chunks. (#2068)
 * Preserve `Authorization` header for redirects that are to the same origin, but are an `http`-to-`https` upgrade. (#2074)
 * When responses have binary output, don't print the output to the console in the command line client. Use output like `<16086 bytes of binary data>` instead. (#2076)
 * Fix display of `--proxies` argument in the command line client help. (#2125)
 * Close responses when task cancellations occur during stream reading. (#2156)
 * Fix type error on accessing `.request` on `HTTPError` exceptions. (#2158)</pre>

* Support for [the SOCKS5 proxy protocol](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#socks) via [the `socksio` package](https://github.com/sethmlarson/socksio). (#2034)
* Support for custom headers in multipart/form-data requests (#1936)

### Fixed

* Don't perform unreliable close/warning on `__del__` with unclosed clients. (#2026)

    <section>
      <h2>Version 0.21.0 (2021-11-15)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.21.0 (15th November, 2021)

The 0.21.0 release integrates against a newly redesigned `httpcore` backend.

Both packages ought to automatically update to the required versions, but if you are
seeing any issues, you should ensure that you have `httpx==0.21.*` and `httpcore==0.14.*` installed.

### Added

* The command-line client will now display connection information when `-v/--verbose` is used.
* The command-line client will now display server certificate information when `-v/--verbose` is used.
* The command-line client is now able to properly detect if the outgoing request
should be formatted as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, based on the result of the HTTP/2 negotiation.</pre>

      <h2>Version 0.20.0 (2021-10-13)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.20.0 (13th October, 2021)

The 0.20.0 release adds an integrated command-line client, and also includes some design changes. The most notable of these is that redirect responses are no longer automatically followed, unless specifically requested.

This design decision prioritises a more explicit approach to redirects, in order to avoid code that unintentionally issues multiple requests as a result of misconfigured URLs.

For example, previously a client configured to send requests to `http://api.github.com/` would end up sending every API request twice, as each request would be redirected to `https://api.github.com/`.

If you do want auto-redirect behaviour, you can enable this either by configuring the client instance with `Client(follow_redirects=True)`, or on a per-request basis, with `.get(..., follow_redirects=True)`.

This change is a classic trade-off between convenience and precision, with no "right" answer. See [discussion #1785](https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1785) for more context.

The other major design change is an update to the Transport API, which is the low-level interface against which requests are sent. Previously this interface used only primitive datastructures, like so...

```python
(status_code, headers, stream, extensions) = transport.handle_request(method, url, headers, stream, extensions)
try
    ...
finally:
    stream.close()
```

Now the interface is much simpler...

```python
response = transport.handle_request(request)
try
    ...
finally:
    response.close()
```

### Changed

* The `allow_redirects` flag is now `follow_redirects` and defaults to `False`.
* The `raise_for_status()` method will now raise an exception for any responses except those with 2xx status codes. Previously only 4xx and 5xx status codes would result in an exception.
* The low-level transport API changes to the much simpler `response = transport.handle_request(request)`.
* The `client.send()` method no longer accepts a `timeout=...` argument, but the `client.build_request()` does. This required by the signature change of the Transport API. The request timeout configuration is now stored on the request instance, as `request.extensions['timeout']`.

### Added

* Added the `httpx` command-line client.
* Response instances now include `.is_informational`, `.is_success`, `.is_redirect`, `.is_client_error`, and `.is_server_error` properties for checking 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx response types. Note that the behaviour of `.is_redirect` is slightly different in that it now returns True for all 3xx responses, in order to allow for a consistent set of properties onto the different HTTP status code types. The `response.has_redirect_location` location may be used to determine responses with properly formed URL redirects.

### Fixed

* `response.iter_bytes()` no longer raises a ValueError when called on a response with no content. (Pull #1827)
* The `'wsgi.error'` configuration now defaults to `sys.stderr`, and is corrected to be a `TextIO` interface, not a `BytesIO` interface. Additionally, the WSGITransport now accepts a `wsgi_error` confguration. (Pull #1828)
* Follow the WSGI spec by properly closing the iterable returned by the application. (Pull #1830)

      <h2>Version 0.18.0 (2021-04-27)</h2>
      <pre>## 0.18.0 (27th April, 2021)

The 0.18.x release series formalises our low-level Transport API, introducing the base classes `httpx.BaseTransport` and `httpx.AsyncBaseTransport`.

See the "[Writing custom transports](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#writing-custom-transports)" documentation and the [`httpx.BaseTransport.handle_request()`](https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/397aad98fdc8b7580a5fc3e88f1578b4302c6382/httpx/_transports/base.py#L77-L147) docstring for more complete details on implementing custom transports.

Pull request #1522 includes a checklist of differences from the previous `httpcore` transport API, for developers implementing custom transports.

The following API changes have been issuing deprecation warnings since 0.17.0 onwards, and are now fully deprecated...

* You should now use httpx.codes consistently instead of httpx.StatusCodes.
* Use limits=... instead of pool_limits=....
* Use proxies={"http://": ...} instead of proxies={"http": ...} for scheme-specific mounting.

### Changed

* Transport instances now inherit from `httpx.BaseTransport` or `httpx.AsyncBaseTransport`,
  and should implement either the `handle_request` method or `handle_async_request` method. (Pull #1522, #1550)
* The `response.ext` property and `Response(ext=...)` argument are now named `extensions`. (Pull #1522)
* The recommendation to not use `data=<bytes|str|bytes (a)iterator>` in favour of `content=<bytes|str|bytes (a)iterator>` has now been escalated to a deprecation warning. (Pull #1573)
* Drop `Response(on_close=...)` from API, since it was a bit of leaking implementation detail. (Pull #1572)
* When using a client instance, cookies should always be set on the client, rather than on a per-request basis. We prefer enforcing a stricter API here because it provides clearer expectations around cookie persistence, particularly when redirects occur. (Pull #1574)
* The runtime exception `httpx.ResponseClosed` is now named `httpx.StreamClosed`. (#1584)
* The `httpx.QueryParams` model now presents an immutable interface. The is a discussion on [the design and motivation here](https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1599). Use `client.params = client.params.merge(...)` instead of `client.params.update(...)`. The basic query manipulation methods are `query.set(...)`, `query.add(...)`, and `query.remove()`. (#1600)

### Added

* The `Request` and `Response` classes can now be serialized using pickle. (#1579)
* Handle `data={"key": [None|int|float|bool]}` cases. (Pull #1539)
* Support `httpx.URL(**kwargs)`, for example `httpx.URL(scheme="https", host="www.example.com", path="/')`, or `httpx.URL("https://www.example.com/", username="tom@gmail.com", password="123 456")`. (Pull #1601)
* Support `url.copy_with(params=...)`. (Pull #1601)
* Add `url.params` parameter, returning an immutable `QueryParams` instance. (Pull #1601)
* Support query manipulation methods on the URL class. These are `url.copy_set_param()`, `url.copy_add_param()`, `url.copy_remove_param()`, `url.copy_merge_params()`. (Pull #1601)
* The `httpx.URL` class now performs port normalization, so `:80` ports are stripped from `http` URLs and `:443` ports are stripped from `https` URLs. (Pull #1603)
* The `URL.host` property returns unicode strings for internationalized domain names. The `URL.raw_host` property returns byte strings with IDNA escaping applied. (Pull #1590)

### Fixed

* Fix Content-Length for cases of `files=...` where unicode string is used as the file content. (Pull #1537)
* Fix some cases of merging relative URLs against `Client(base_url=...)`. (Pull #1532)
* The `request.content` attribute is now always available except for streaming content, which requires an explicit `.read()`. (Pull #1583)</pre>
