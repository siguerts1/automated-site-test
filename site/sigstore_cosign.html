      <h2>v2.4.0 (2024-08-06)</h2>
      <pre>v2.4.0 begins the modernization of the Cosign client, which includes:

* Support for the newer Sigstore specification-compliant bundle format
* Support for providing trust roots (e.g. Fulcio certificates, Rekor keys)
  through a trust root file, instead of many different flags
* Conformance test suite integration to verify signing and verification behavior

In future updates, we'll include:

* General support for the trust root file, instead of only when using the bundle
  format during verification
* Simplification of trust root flags and deprecation of the
  Cosign-specific bundle format
* Bundle support with container signing

We have also moved nightly Cosign container builds to GHCR instead of GCR.

## Features

* Add new bundle support to `verify-blob` and `verify-blob-attestation` (#3796)
* Adding protobuf bundle support to sign-blob and attest-blob (#3752)
* Bump sigstore/sigstore to support `email_verified` as string or boolean (#3819)
* Conformance testing for cosign (#3806)
* move incremental builds per commit to GHCR instead of GCR (#3808)
* Add support for recording creation timestamp for cosign attest (#3797)
* Include SCT verification failure details in error message (#3799)

      <pre>
> # Highlights
> **fix**: Pulls Fulcio root and intermediate when `--certificate-chain` is not passed into `verify-blob` command. The `v1.12.0` release introduced a regression: when `COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL` was not set, cosign `verify-blob` would check a ` --certificate` (without a `--certificate-chain` provided) against the operating system root CA bundle. In this release, Cosign checks the certificate against Fulcio's CA root instead (restoring the earlier behavior).


## What's Changed
* fix: fix cert chain validation for verify-blob in non-experimental mode by @asraa in https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/2256
* fix: add COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 for verify-bloba by @developer-guy in https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/2254
* Fix BYO-root with intermediate to fetch intermediates from annotation by @haydentherapper in https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/2244

      <h2>v1.12.0 (2022-09-14)</h2>
      <pre>**Note: This release comes with a fix for `CVE-2022-36056` described in this [Github Security Advisory](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388). Please upgrade to this release ASAP**

> # Highlights
> **BREAKING:** The fix for [GHSA-GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388) (CVE-2022-36056) means that some `verify-blob` commands that used to work may not anymore. In particular:
> - When using `verify-blob` with signatures created with keyless mode, we require either `COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1` or a valid Rekor bundle for offline verification passed with `--bundle`.
>
> If you upgrade and encounter other issues, please read the advisory in full; your prior checks may have been passing inappropriately.
