  <h1>🚀 ory/hydra - Release Notes</h1>
  
    <section>
      <h2>v2.3.0 (2025-01-17)</h2>
      <pre>We’re thrilled to announce the release of **Ory Hydra 2.3.0**! This version comes packed with **graceful token refresh**, performance improvements, and fixes that enhance stability, reduce database load, and streamline the developer experience. We strongly recommend upgrading to take advantage of these enhancements and ensure the best possible OAuth2 and OpenID Connect experience with Ory Hydra. Thank you to everyone who contributed!

Ory Hydra now supports graceful refresh token rotation, making OAuth2 and OpenID Connect refresh flows significantly more resilient in scenarios such as Single Page Apps and IoT. Even in highly distributed or concurrent environments, Hydra gracefully handles token refreshes reliably, ensuring tokens are not dropped or double-used.

PRs: [#3860](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3860), [#3895](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3895)

Previously, the `redirect_uri` was not required when performing flows with `scope=openid`. This release enforces the requirement to comply with the OpenID Connect standard.

PR: [#3900](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3900)

Hydra now supports explicit SQL migration commands **`migrate sql up|down|status`** that streamline database schema management and help with zero-downtime upgrades.

PR: [#3894](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3894)

- **Access token strategy & advanced CLI improvements**
  The CLI introduces new parameters and an option to specify a custom client ID on creation, making it easier to manage and script Hydra deployments.
  PRs: [#3718](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3718), [#3725](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3725), [#3874](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3874)
- **Built-in login & consent UI for `hydra perform authorization-code`**
  A minimal built-in UI for login and consent can be enabled when testing with the CLI, removing the need to spin up a separate service.
  PR: [#3845](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3845)

Unused indices have been removed, down migration scripts renamed for consistency, and all migrations are more efficient overall.

- **Fix Docker Compose references**
  The CLI now properly references `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`, ensuring compatibility with modern Docker setups.
  PR: [#3815](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3815)

- **Dependency upgrades**
  Bumped `fosite`, `ory/x`, `pgx/v5`, and various third-party libraries for improved stability and performance.
- **Updated docs**
  Updated examples, improved JWK documentation, added notes on Docker Compose usage, and refined OpenID Connect discovery docs.
- **More tracing context**
  Tracing calls have been consistently standardized with `otelx.End()`, and additional context ensures better observability.
- **Code generation & housekeeping**
  Various housekeeping tasks: pinned GHA versions, fixed minor comment typos, updated newsletters/links, and more.

To upgrade to 2.3.0, follow the usual steps:

1. **Back up your database** (always recommended).
2. **Update your Hydra version** in your Docker configuration, binary, or build to `v2.3.0`.
3. **Run `hydra migrate sql up`** (if using the new commands) or your usual migration procedure.
4. **Restart your services** and confirm that Hydra is up and running.

Check the [migration docs](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/self-hosted/upgrade) for detailed information.

**Full Changelog**: [v2.2.0...v2.3.0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0)

_Happy building with Ory Hydra!_

## Breaking Changes

Going forward, OAuth2 Clients requesting an OpenID Connect flow **must** include the `redirect_uri` parameter or the request will be rejected.

Deleting consents no longer returns 404 in certain edge cases but instead always 204.

### Bug Fixes

- Advertise support for response_mode=form_post in OIDC discovery document ([#3861](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3861)) ([9cc5f28](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/9cc5f28825bb80398a9830d4fcb220147f74504c))
- Broken JSON round-tripping for custom claims ([b36b701](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b36b701026d7d7324b0b04529f134d3ed1eb9eb7)):

  Adding custom claims with numerical types (think JavaScript Number) previously did not
  round-trip through Hydra correctly. For example, passing UNIX timestamps in custom claims
  would end up as floating points in exponential notation in the final token. That, in turn,
  confused or broke downstream consumers of the token, including Kratos.

- Change comment on revokeOAuth2LoginSessions ([#3853](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3853)) ([6d829dd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6d829ddb251f9e9f1a49a91438c1bd684e827021))
- Change index name in down migration ([#3911](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3911)) ([3a09db2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/3a09db2abb978df91d875333b1eca70014cdcd10))
- Correct span names ([554238b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/554238b6da4e1d8ad690b1bf359e532382571884))
- Correctly pass multiple token audiences and prompt parameters when performing the authorization code flow from the CLI ([#3736](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3736)) ([632faef](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/632faef15228c2d0a2caedfc3d7c6a3782c2e131))
- Cpu contention when reading JWKs and suppress generating duplicate JWKs ([#3870](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3870)) ([d5f65c5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d5f65c570a02a999867f323630d2a5d099526054)):

  Previously each concurrent caller would need to lock a shared mutex when reading or writing a given JWK set.
  The read path now doesn't require locking a mutex at all and instead returns valid query results directly.

  The write path is now protected by a concurrency control mechanism (using x/sync/singleflight) to ensure only one JWK set is generated and persisted.

  Note: Duplicate JWK sets may still be improperly generated if running more than one Hydra instance in a high traffic environment.

- Do not iteratively delete records ([#3766](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3766)) ([5ef20a2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5ef20a2a2bc91ccde79517667ae4bf4a36c833ba)):

- Error log when RP responds with status code 204 ([#3731](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3731)) ([153e4b5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/153e4b56e6de645ee44e4e7833c32a3890e43c54))
- Faster GetPublicKeys ([#3787](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3787)) ([04c34aa](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/04c34aaf2e3c523f4658910d570de80de328d138)):

  GetPublicKeys used to fetch all keys in a set, even if they were actually not being used. This patch fixes that.

- Improve docker set up ([#3924](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3924)) ([8ca6cbd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8ca6cbd1ab4fe659a0a9feff82766961de6c1d77)), closes [#3914](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3914) [#3683](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3683):

  Improves the docker set up and removes some unused files.

- Incorrect context passthru ([fa50e3e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/fa50e3e999ef962fb522dfa2f9a1f6ffa20848bf))
- Incorrect indices ([#3778](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3778)) ([cb0004b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/cb0004b67b2818b3bca397e98c1bb5bcbb62296f))
- Limit HTTP response size ([2559819](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/25598191ee862b764ff160755b79fab0e95e5136))
- Omit explicit transaction in ConfirmLoginSession and add tracing ([#3886](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3886)) ([a5b2d75](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a5b2d75d4eeab6f26561f7a63cec24ccc7ed1127))
- Pass context to database ping ([fa21711](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/fa217119494e56b043810cd5ba8e8e230a24ea94))

- Untyped int build issues on 32bit architectures ([#3885](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3885)) ([68aa167](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/68aa16725f529136d3f7d0282158ff8c9b11bd22))
- Upgrade fosite and improve webhook integration ([#3727](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3727)) ([89323e2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/89323e24de470c2b0f3037e0cf8f99bc4373d4fd))
- Use docker compose rather than docker-compose ([#3815](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3815)) ([ffdfb73](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ffdfb7362a8de6f6f0608879bf034602f01ea250))

  ```

  commands.

  See https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/7350

- Built-in login/consent UI for `hydra perform authorization-code` ([#3845](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3845)) ([7f8bd90](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/7f8bd90c2ccbf8be553d526890459f85940c8e99))
- Graceful refresh token rotation ([#3860](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3860)) ([e278b40](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/e278b405e53f6e00f3012a49f14938443d6e7882)), closes [#1831](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1831) [#3770](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3770):

  This patch adds a configuration flag which enables graceful refresh token rotation. Previously, refresh tokens could only be used once. On reuse, all tokens of that chain would be revoked.

  This is particularly challenging in environments, where it's difficult to make guarantees on synchronization. This could lead to refresh tokens being sent twice due to some parallel execution.

  To resolve this, refresh tokens can now be graceful by changing `oauth2.grant.refresh_token.grace_period=10s` (example value). During this time, a refresh token can be used multiple times to generate new refresh, ID, and access tokens.

  All tokens will correctly be invalidated, when the refresh token is re-used after the grace period expires, or when the delete consent endpoint is used.

- Handle concurrent refreshes and improve graceful refreshing ([#3895](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3895)) ([0a6c966](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/0a6c96620674e880cfbff2e077f7faf12ca0e446)):

  This patch improves Ory Hydra's ability to deal with refresh flows which, for example, concurrently refresh the same token. Furthermore, graceful token refresh has been improved to handle a variety of edge cases and scenarios.

  Additionally, serializability errors in CockroachDB are now correctly retried.

  See https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/7311
  Closes https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/3895

- Improve persistence logic ([#3756](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3756)) ([50301e0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/50301e0022ca64c9d0823544c7b664309620c70e))
- Reduce size of verifiers ([#3857](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3857)) ([0cd00dc](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/0cd00dcb0e1390165ae94631fef3980f5b8df40e))
- Remove unused indices ([#3859](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3859)) ([56fc3da](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/56fc3da6297eab16e2aa65818dd149104557b332))
- Support more claims in password grant ([#3864](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3864)) ([41476ec](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/41476ec06275bc348ed4117e9e0223d04bdebfa5)):

  For the resource owner password grant, the Kratos identity ID is now written to the sub claim, and the username is written to the ext.username claim. Further, token hooks are called for the initial token issuance as well as refresh flows for access tokens issued via the resource owner password grant, allowing users to customize the fields present in the access token (for the jwt strategy) as well as on introspection.

- Update clients from files through the CLI ([#3874](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3874)) ([f777fd1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f777fd1ac1047575624924d9243f6e532af4f538))
- Upgrade to jackc/pgx/v5 ([#3798](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3798)) ([cd7e7ef](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/cd7e7eff910441f40382f7b71b3fbfae26b6641a))

      <h2>v2.2.0 (2024-02-12)</h2>
      <pre>![Ory Hydra 2.2.0](http://ory.sh/images/newsletter/hydra-2.2.0/banner.png)

Ory Hydra, the OAuth2 and OpenID Connect server designed for web-scale deployments introduces over 6x higher OAuth2 throughput on a single PostgreSQL instance!

Want to check out Ory Hydra yourself? Try common OAuth2 flows in the [Ory OAuth2 Get Started guide](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/ory-network-oauth2)!

This version significantly enhances performance, processing over 6x more authorization flows than version 2.1, thanks to architectural improvements that minimize database interactions for login and consent processes.

Key improvements include:

- Enhanced integration with Ory Kratos, ensuring seamless synchronization of login and logout states across both services. Users logged out from Ory Hydra will automatically log out from Ory Kratos, enhancing security and user experience.
- The ability to bypass the logout consent screen for specific clients, streamlining the logout process.
- Simplified migration with the new feature to import OAuth2 Client IDs, making the transition to Ory Hydra smoother.
- Support for the OIDC Verifiable Credentials specification, expanding the server's capabilities in identity verification.

Thank all contributors who have made this release available!

### Documentation

- Fix typo ([#3649](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3649)) ([f0501d2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f0501d2cd7f30c550cc07f6f583118efc9f12a5f))

### Features

- Add --skip-logout-consent flag to CLI ([#3709](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3709)) ([f502d6e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f502d6e38747986cca2ce42b0854f194e85ed103))
- Add authentication options to hooks ([#3633](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3633)) ([5c8e792](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5c8e7923ed22f6d231ca748bb76e4261a87afb08))
- Add flag to export public keys ([#3684](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3684)) ([62c006b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/62c006b916351e7f74fb00e0006ea112801143d7))
- Add missing index for jwk table ([#3691](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3691)) ([39ee5e1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/39ee5e1f0cfa7fae5c4f9e1663a930cb5b8c2bc9))
- Add prompt=registration ([#3636](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3636)) ([19857d2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/19857d20b1d7d3b918de5388f17076de0660a6be)):

  Ory Hydra now supports a `registration` value for the `prompt` parameter of
  the authorization request. When specifying `prompt=registration`, Ory Hydra
  will redirect the user to the URL found under `urls.registration`
  (instead of `urls.login`).

- Add skip_logout_consent option to clients ([#3705](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3705)) ([2a653e6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/2a653e66803ddb03de02d981dbc8ea57b2ac0936)):

  Adds a special field which disables the logout consent screen when performing OIDC logout.

- Allow injecting extra fosite strategies ([#3646](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3646)) ([88b0b7c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/88b0b7cfdf1a1968bf3a720cb2e6640451e2956b))
- Re-enable legacy client IDs ([#3628](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3628)) ([5dd7d30](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5dd7d306ba8181b1fff1225d056a2ee69183392e)):

  This patch changes the primary key of the `hydra_client` table. We do not expect issues, as that table is probably not overly huge in any deployment. We do however highly recommend to test the migration performance on a staging environment with a similar database setup.

- Remove flow cookie ([#3639](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3639)) ([cde3a30](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/cde3a30a92bc30cf072763503e9780a79ba44e43)):

  This patch removes the flow cookie. All information is already tracked in the request query parameters as part of the {login|consent}\_{challenge|verifier}.

- Remove login session cookie during consent flow ([#3667](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3667)) ([5f41949](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5f41949ad209c90d114dc427bd6ccde5e08f05da))
- Support multiple token URLs ([#3676](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3676)) ([95cc273](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/95cc2735ed18374cc01d625c66417e42b600778d))

- Add `hydra migrate status` subcommand ([#3579](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3579)) ([749eb8d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/749eb8db40fb8b2d6333d917fac6c25b6e5574ef))
- Add more resolution to events and collect client metrics ([#3568](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3568)) ([466e66b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/466e66bd1df7bf589c5a74ad5be399b1eaa80d9b))
- Add state override ([b8b9154](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b8b9154077963492dad3ed0350a4d93d09a95602))
- Add support for OIDC VC ([#3575](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3575)) ([219a7c0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/219a7c068fa0ec423923f157553f430c80934c45)):

  This adds initial support for issuing verifiable credentials
  as specified in https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-userinfo-vc-1_0.html.

  Because the spec is still in draft, public identifiers are
  suffixed with `draft_00`.

- Allow additional SQL migrations ([#3587](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3587)) ([8900cbb](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8900cbb770d6f39a5c3322fce488675ca6d0138a))
- Allow Go migrations ([#3602](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3602)) ([8eed306](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8eed306800fa330a1cda752dbb11ddf09faf25ad))
- Allow to disable claim mirroring ([#3563](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3563)) ([c72a316](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c72a31641ee79f090a2ac1b64a276be58312b2ee)):

  This PR introduces another config option called `oauth2:mirror_top_level_claims` which may be used to disable the mirroring of custom claims into the `ext` claim of the jwt.
  This new config option is an opt-in. If unused the behavior remains as-is to ensure backwards compatibility.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  oauth2:
    allowed_top_level_claims:
      - test_claim
    mirror_top_level_claims: false # -> this will prevent test_claim to be mirrored within ext
  ```

  Closes https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3348

- Bump fosite and add some more tracing ([0b56f53](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/0b56f53a491e165f68a53f013989328ce86928ba))
- **cmd:** Add route that redirects to the auth code url ([4db6416](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4db64161699e4301c003b2787baecae22c912c17))
- Parallel generation of JSON web key set ([#3561](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3561)) ([5bd9002](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5bd9002db7baa2fe2c2529fee38825d66a68991f))
- Propagate logout to identity provider ([#3596](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3596)) ([c004fee](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c004fee69497a5a0f8af5ccb6a2ab8d104fd9249)):

  - feat: propagate logout to identity provider

  This commit improves the integration between Hydra and Kratos when logging
  out the user.

  This adds a new configuration key for configuring a Kratos admin URL.
  Additionally, Kratos can send a session ID when accepting a login request.
  If a session ID was specified and a Kratos admin URL was configured,
  Hydra will disable the corresponding Kratos session through the admin API
  if a frontchannel or backchannel logout was triggered.

  - fix: add special case for MySQL
  - chore: update sdk
  - chore: consistent naming
  - fix: cleanup persister

- Support different jwt scope claim strategies ([#3531](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3531)) ([45da11e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/45da11e4fb4f0a2f939f11682c095b8dbfcddb78))

- Only query access tokens by hashed signature ([a21e945](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a21e94519416cc7801995b0804696348b18fa844))

### Code Generation

- Pin v2.2.0-rc.3 release commit ([ad8a4ba](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ad8a4bab63b352c0b259a97d7b3f23247b0238b1))

### Features

- Add `hydra migrate status` subcommand ([#3579](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3579)) ([749eb8d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/749eb8db40fb8b2d6333d917fac6c25b6e5574ef))
- Add more resolution to events and collect client metrics ([#3568](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3568)) ([466e66b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/466e66bd1df7bf589c5a74ad5be399b1eaa80d9b))

  This adds initial support for issuing verifiable credentials
  as specified in https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-userinfo-vc-1_0.html.

  Because the spec is still in draft, public identifiers are
  suffixed with `draft_00`.

- Allow additional SQL migrations ([#3587](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3587)) ([8900cbb](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8900cbb770d6f39a5c3322fce488675ca6d0138a))

- Allow to disable claim mirroring ([#3563](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3563)) ([c72a316](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c72a31641ee79f090a2ac1b64a276be58312b2ee)):

  This PR introduces another config option called `oauth2:mirror_top_level_claims` which may be used to disable the mirroring of custom claims into the `ext` claim of the jwt.
  This new config option is an opt-in. If unused the behavior remains as-is to ensure backwards compatibility.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  oauth2:

      - test_claim

  - feat: propagate logout to identity provider

  This commit improves the integration between Hydra and Kratos when logging
  out the user.

  This adds a new configuration key for configuring a Kratos admin URL.
  Additionally, Kratos can send a session ID when accepting a login request.
  If a session ID was specified and a Kratos admin URL was configured,
  Hydra will disable the corresponding Kratos session through the admin API
  if a frontchannel or backchannel logout was triggered.

  - fix: add special case for MySQL
  - chore: update sdk
  - chore: consistent naming
  - fix: cleanup persister

- Support different jwt scope claim strategies ([#3531](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3531)) ([45da11e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/45da11e4fb4f0a2f939f11682c095b8dbfcddb78))

      <h2>v2.2.0-rc.2 (2023-06-13)</h2>
      <pre>This release optimizes the performance of authorization code grant flows by minimizing the number of database queries. We acheive this by storing the flow in an AEAD-encoded cookie and AEAD-encoded request parameters for the authentication and consent screens.

BREAKING CHANGE:

- The client that is used as part of the authorization grant flow is stored in the AEAD-encoding. Therefore, running flows will not observe updates to the client after they were started.
- Because the login and consent challenge values now include the AEAD-encoded flow, their size increased to around 1kB for a flow without any metadata (and increases linearly with the amount of metadata). Please adjust your ingress / gateway accordingly.

### Bug Fixes

      <h2>v2.1.2 (2023-05-24)</h2>
      <pre>We are excited to announce the next Ory Hydra release! This release includes the following important changes:

- Fixed a memory leak in the OpenTelemetry implementation, improving overall memory usage and stability.
- Added a missing index for faster janitor cleanup, resulting in quicker and more efficient cleanup operations.
- Fixed a bug related to SameSite in dev mode, ensuring proper functionality and consistency in handling SameSite attributes during development.

We appreciate your continuous support and feedback. Please feel free to reach out to us with any further suggestions or issues.

### Bug Fixes

- Add index on requested_at for refresh tokens and use it in janitor ([#3516](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3516)) ([5b8e712](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5b8e7121c49a0dfed6312b599a617e692f324fdb))
- Disable health check request logs ([#3496](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3496)) ([eddf7f3](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/eddf7f3867e8977e58d09681c583e99bca503448))
- Do not use prepared SQL statements and bump deps ([#3506](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3506)) ([31b9e66](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/31b9e663b183f8244d86ddd1ae9f55267e190a69))
- Proper SameSite=None in dev mode ([#3502](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3502)) ([5751fae](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5751fae7b37a2692ad484c785356e702928f1b9b))
- Sqa config values unified across projects ([#3490](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3490)) ([1b1899e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1b1899e9472fecfbdeb07f5e99c27713b82478e5))
- **sql:** Incorrect JWK query ([#3499](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3499)) ([13ce0d6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/13ce0d6f39febed83c6b1e10b45b0be2ed75a415)):

  `persister_grant_jwk` had an OR statement without bracket leading to not using the last part of the query.

### Code Generation

      <h2>v2.0.3 (2022-12-08)</h2>
      <pre>Bugfixes for migration and pagination regressions and a new endpoint.

### Bug Fixes

- Add `client_id` and `client_secret` to `revokeOAuth2Token` ([#3373](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3373)) ([93bac07](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/93bac074b3f7bd347c329377bf8c14aed7f43c00))
- Docker build ([48217bd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/48217bd203af9467eae570b2c47c777a6c1e929b))
- Introspect command CLI example ([#3353](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3353)) ([4ee4456](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4ee4456d884ef6925a74c26768537e9a1ca8a9a6))
- Invalidate tokens with inconsistent state ([#3385](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3385)) ([542ea77](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/542ea771c9740a1ebf5bc0006cb59e9eaff688d2)), closes [#3346](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3346):

  This patch includes SQL migrations targeting environments which have not yet migrated to Ory Hydra 2.0. It removes inconsistent records which resolves issues during the migrations process. Please be aware that some users might be affected by this change. They might need to re-authorize certain apps. However, most active records should not be affected by this.

  Installations already on Ory Hydra 2.0 will not be affected by this change.

- No longer auto-generate system secret ([c5fe043](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c5fe0433be88dc3cbcd09b8c85c3a90819109681)):

  This patch changes Ory Hydra's behavior to no longer auto-generate a temporary secret when no global secret was set. The APIs now return an error instead.

  See https://github.com/ory/network/issues/185

- Prevent multiple redirections to post logout url ([#3366](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3366)) ([50666b9](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/50666b96ef28a019f5dfd9758f50c0023ad4ae05)), closes [#3342](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3342)
- Strip `public` from schema ([#3374](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3374)) ([3831b44](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/3831b4482a525cf67b519064bfefd45fe9f3cbd3)), closes [#3367](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3367)
- Token pagination ([#3384](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3384)) ([e8d8de9](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/e8d8de9072fda61b6d651107005d12f7bac0cba7)), closes [#3362](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3362)

### Code Generation

- Pin v2.0.3 release commit ([16831c5](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/16831c55c41e64dd73637e8e2ca8f22202fc7d87))

### Features

- List consent sessions by session id ([#2853](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2853)) ([d275ad6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d275ad66a4e3cb9494eeae7756acf33a76c37892))

      <h2>v2.0.2 (2022-11-10)</h2>
      <pre>This release resolves bugs and SDK publishing issues.

### Bug Fixes

- Add v2 suffix ([#3340](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3340)) ([c54b9db](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c54b9dbf9acf0cd066969b6c729605f1e52e943a))
- Correct migration file name ([01f80a8](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/01f80a850112ca4a30330eeaa8eca35af4a91467))

- Isolate transactions for crdb ([f22046f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f22046fcee445dbc0b8c8bc49a9eb053ed485dab))
- Scope type should be string instead of int ([#3337](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3337)) ([f59f1c6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f59f1c68346f8083e3d4e1d47117e014e644c376)):

      <h2>v2.0.0 (2022-10-27)</h2>
      <pre>Ory Hydra 2.0 is available now! It ships major internal data restructuring and adds support for additional OAuth2 flows such as OAuth2 Token Exchange. Ory Hydra now natively integrates with [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos), an open source Identity Server.

Install the Ory CLI for the best developer experience to try out Ory Hydra 2.0 right away!

```shell
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) -b . ory
sudo mv ./ory /usr/local/bin/

brew install ory/tap/cli
```

create a new project (you may also use [Docker](https://www.ory.sh/docs/hydra/5min-tutorial))

```
ory create project --name "Ory Hydra 2.0 Example"
project_id="{set to the id from output}"
```

and follow the quick & easy steps below.

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client, and run the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow:

```shell
ory create oauth2-client --project $project_id \
    --name "Client Credentials Demo" \
    --grant-type client_credentials
client_id="{set to client id from output}"
client_secret="{set to client secret from output}"

ory perform client-credentials --client-id=$client_id --client-secret=$client_secret --project $project_id
access_token="{set to access token from output}"

ory introspect token $access_token --project $project_id
```

Try out the OAuth 2.0 Authorize Code grant right away!

By accepting permissions `openid` and `offline_access` at the consent screen, Ory refreshes and OpenID Connect ID token,

```shell
ory create oauth2-client --project $project_id \
    --name "Authorize Code with OpenID Connect Demo" \
    --grant-type authorization_code \
    --response-type code \
    --redirect-uri ttp://127.0.0.1:4446/callback
code_client_id="{set to client id from output}"
code_client_secret="{set to client secret from output}"

ory perform authorization-code \
    --project $project_id \
    --client-id $code_client_id \
    --client-secret $code_client_secret
code_access_token="{set to access token from output}"

ory introspect token $code_access_token --project $project_id
```

### What's changed in Ory Hydra 2.0?

- Ory Identities is now compatible with the Ory OAuth2 Login and Consent Flow. This means, for example, that Ory Kratos can be the login provider for Ory Hydra with a bit of configuration.
- The Ory Network enables this integration as a default.
- Ory Hydra 2.0 now natively supports key types such as ES256 for signing ID Tokens and OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens in JWT format.
- Additionally, the key naming mechanism was updated to conform with industry best practices.
- Ory Hydra 2.0 ships a complete refactoring of the internal database structure, reducing database storage at scale and optimizing query performance.
- All primary keys are now UUIDs to avoid hotspots in distributed systems. Please note that as part of this change it is no longer possible to choose the OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Instead, Ory chooses the best-performing ID format for the petabyte scale.
- Ory chose to denormalize tables that had a negative performance impact due to excessive JOIN statements.
- Using BCrypt as the primary hashing algorithm for OAuth 2.0 Client Secrets creates excessive CPU consumption at scale. OAuth 2.0 Client Secrets are auto-generated in Ory Hydra 2.x, removing the need for excessive hashing costs.
- The new PKBDF2 hasher can be fine-tuned to support hashing at scale without a significant threat model impact.
- This section only applies in scenarios where Ory Hydra is working in a do-it-yourself fashion e.g. on Docker. An Ory Hydra 2.0 compatible service is already available on the [Ory Network](https://www.ory.sh).
- The database schema changed significantly from the previous structure. Please be aware that there might be a period where the database tables will be locked for writes while the upgrade runs. **A full backup of the database before upgrading is essential!** We recommend trying out the upgrade on a copy of a production database first.

### Detailed Overview

Find a list of detailed changes below!

#### SQL Migrations

To run the SQL migrations using:

```
hydra migrate sql $DSN
```

#### SDK changes

Ory Hydra 1.x is a crucial service at Ory. Version 2.0 streamlines the APIs and SDKs to follow Ory API’s semantics and specification.

To better support TB-scale environments, the OAuth2 Client HTTP API's query
parameters for pagination have changed from `limit` and `offset` to `page_token`
and `page_size`. The `page_token` is an opaque string contained in the HTTP
`Link` Header, which expresses the next, previous, first, and last page.

Administrative endpoints now have an `/admin` prefix (e.g. `POST /admin/keys` instead of `POST /keys`). Existing administrative endpoints will redirect to this new prefixed path for backward compatibility.

HTTP endpoint `/oauth2/flush`, used to flush inactive access tokens was deprecated and has been removed. Please use `hydra janitor` instead.

To conform with the Ory V1 SDK, several SDK methods and payloads were renamed. Please check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

#### Configuration changes

The `iss` (issuer) value no longer appends a trailing slash but instead uses the raw value set in the config.

Setting

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
```

has changed

```patch
- "iss": "https://auth.example.com/"
+ "iss": "https://auth.example.com"
```

To set a trailing slash make sure to set it in the config value:

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com/
```

#### CLI Changes

Flags `--dangerous-allow-insecure-redirect-url` and `--dangerous-force-http` have been removed. Use the `--dev` flag instead to denote a development environment with reduced security restrictions.

We now recommend using the [Ory CLI](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/cli/installation) to manage OAuth2 resources. As part of this restructuring, some of the commands were renamed. Here are some examples:

```patch
- hydra client create
+ ory create oauth2-client

- hydra clients list
+ ory list oauth2-clients
```

Additionally, array arguments now use the singular form:

```patch
hydra create client \
- --redirect-uris foo --redirect-uris bar \
+ --redirect-uri foo --redirect-uri bar \
- --grant-types foo --grant-types bar \
+ --grant-type foo --grant-type bar \
- --response-types foo --response-types bar \
+ --response-type foo --response-type bar \
- --allowed-cors-origins foo --allowed-cors-origins bar \
+ --allowed-cors-origin foo --allowed-cors-origin bar \
- --post-logout-callbacks foo --post-logout-callbacks bar \
+ --post-logout-callback foo --post-logout-callback bar
```

To manage resources in a do-it-yourself installation, continue using the `hydra` CLI.

Please check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ory/hydra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

Ory Hydra 2.0 ships with support for OpenTelemetry. The previous telemetry solution using OpenTracing format is deprecated with this release.

We removed compatibility with unsupported database versions (e.g. MySQL 5.6). Ory Hydra v2.x is now compatible with MySQL 8.0.13+, PostgreSQL 11.8+, CockroachDB v22.1.2+.

Configuration keys have changed:

```patch
serve: {
  public: {
-    access_log: {
+    request_log: {
      disable_for_health: true
    },
  },
  admin: {

      disable_for_health: true
    },
  }
}
```

This release updates SDK services from `public` and `admin` to `v2`. Methods exposed at the admin interface are now prefixed with `admin` (e.g. `adminCreateJsonWebKeySet`). Administrative endpoints now have an `/admin` prefix (e.g. `POST /admin/keys`). Existing administrative endpoints will redirect to this new prefixed path for backwards compatibility.

This release updates SDK services from `public` and `admin` to `v2`. Methods exposed at the admin interface are now prefixed with `admin` (e.g. `adminCreateOAuth2Client`). Administrative endpoints now have an `/admin` prefix (e.g. `POST /admin/clients`). Existing administrative endpoints will redirect to this new prefixed path for backwards compatibility.

The default names of cookies have changed:

```patch
- oauth2_authentication_csrf
+ ory_hydra_login_csrf
- oauth2_consent_csrf
+ ory_hydra_consent_csrf
- oauth2_authentication_session
+ ory_hydra_session
```

Use the new configuration option to change the cookie names back to v1.x if required.

CLI flag `--dangerous-force-http` has been removed. Please use the `--dev` flag instead!

CLI flag `--dangerous-allow-insecure-redirect-url` has been removed. Please use the `--dev` flag instead!

The `hydra token revoke` command has been renamed to `hydra revoke token` and now supports structured output (JSON, tables, ...).

The `hydra token introspect` command has been renamed to `hydra introspect token` and now supports structured output (JSON, tables, ...).

The `hydra token delete` command has been renamed to `hydra delete access-tokens` and now supports structured output (JSON, tables, ...).

The `hydra token client` command has been renamed to `hydra perform client-credentials` and now supports structured output (JSON, tables, ...).

The `hydra keys create|delete|get|import` commands have changed to follow other Ory project's guidelines, including structured output and improved handling. They are now:

```
hydra create jwks
hydra get jwks
hydra delete jwks
hydra import jwk
```

Please head over to the documentation for more information or use the `--help` CLI flag for each command.

HTTP endpoint `/oauth2/flush`, used to flush inactive access token was deprecated and has been removed. Please use `hydra janitor` instead.

Command `hydra clients import` is now `hydra import client`.

Command `hydra clients update` is now `hydra update client`. Additionally, all flags are now singular:

```patch
hydra update client [client-id] \
- --redirect-uris foo --redirect-uris bar \
+ --redirect-uri foo --redirect-uri bar \
- --grant-types foo --grant-types bar \
+ --grant-type foo --grant-type bar \
- --response-types foo --response-types bar \
+ --response-type foo --response-type bar \
- --allowed-cors-origins foo --allowed-cors-origins bar \
+ --allowed-cors-origin foo --allowed-cors-origin bar \
- --post-logout-callbacks foo --post-logout-callbacks bar \
+ --post-logout-callback foo --post-logout-callback bar
```

To better support TB-scale environments, the OAuth2 Client HTTP API's query parameters for pagination have changed from `limit` and `offset` to `page_token` and `page_size`. The `page_token` is an opaque string contained in the HTTP `Link` Header, which expresses the next, previous, first, and last page.

Command `hydra clients list` is now `hydra list client`. Please notice that the pagination flags have changed to `--page-token` and `page-size`!

Command `hydra clients delete` is now `hydra delete client`.

Command `hydra clients get` is now `hydra get client`.

Command `hydra clients create` is now `hydra create client`. Additionally, all flags are now singular:

```patch
hydra create client \
- --redirect-uris foo --redirect-uris bar \
+ --redirect-uri foo --redirect-uri bar \
- --grant-types foo --grant-types bar \
+ --grant-type foo --grant-type bar \
- --response-types foo --response-types bar \
+ --response-type foo --response-type bar \
- --allowed-cors-origins foo --allowed-cors-origins bar \
+ --allowed-cors-origin foo --allowed-cors-origin bar \
- --post-logout-callbacks foo --post-logout-callbacks bar \
+ --post-logout-callback foo --post-logout-callback bar
```

This change is backwards compatible, but changes the default hashing algorithm to PBKDF2. To keep using BCrypt for hashing new OAuth2 Client Secrets set the following configuration option in your configuration file:

```
oauth2:
  hashers:
    algorithm: bcrypt
```

To improve security and scalability (in particular sharding), OAuth 2.0 Client IDs can no longer be chosen but are always assigned a random generated UUID V4. OAuth 2.0 Clients created with custom IDs before the v2.0 release will continue working with their legacy Client ID in Ory Hydra v2.x.

Additionally, the `hydra create client` command no longer supports flag `--id` and flag `--callbacks` has been renamed to `--redirect-uris`.

The `iss` (issuer) value no longer appends a trailing slash but instead uses the raw value set in the config.

Setting

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
```

has changed

```patch
-  "iss": "https://auth.example.com/"
+  "iss": "https://auth.example.com"
```

To set a trailing slash make sure to set it in the config value:

```yaml
urls:
  self:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com/
```

SDK object `PatchDocument` was renamed to `JsonPatchDocument`.

TLS is no longer enabled by default. We want to make deployments behind TLS termination easier. To expose Ory Hydra directly to the public internet, configure keys `serve.<public|admin>.tls`.

JSON Web Keys are no longer prefixed with `public` or `private`. This affects keys generated in Ory Hydra after upgrading to this patch. Existing keys are unaffected by this.

OAuth2 errors can no longer be returned in the legacy error format. Essentially, fields `error_hint`, `error_debug` have been removed. Option `oauth2.include_legacy_error_fields` has been removed.

The HS512 and HS256 JSON Web Key generators has been removed. It is now only possible to generate asymmetric keys in Ory Hydra. It will still be possible to save HS512 or HS256 keys.

if using MySQL, hydra_jwk/kid and hydra_oauth2_trusted_jwt_bearer_issuer/key_id may only contain ascii/utf-8 symbols 0-127

Encode MySQL columns hydra_oauth2_trusted_jwt_bearer_issuer/key_id and hydra_jwk/kid in ascii as
a workaround for the 3072-byte index entry size limit[1].

This patch merges four SQL Tables into a new table, deleting the old tables in the process. The migrations in this patch are expected to be applied offline. Please be aware that _there are no down migrations_, and if something goes wrong, data loss is possible. Always back up your database before applying migrations. For more information, see [Hydra 2.x Migration Guide](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/guides/migrate-v2).

Rows with NULL login_challenge in `hydra_oauth2_consent_request` and corresponding `hydra_oauth2_consent_request_handled` are deleted as a side effect of the merge migration. This is done with the assumption that only a very small number of sessions, issued by pre-1.0 Hydra, will be affected. Please contact us if this assumption doesn't apply or if the deletion adversely affects your deployment.

- Optimise sql update to avoid redundant writes ([#3289](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3289)) ([1aa6cc4](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1aa6cc43f2a270f1853b6634f5af26344d077a97)), closes [#3137](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3137):

  The SQL update here would potentially update a lot of rows, which did not need updating. In some DB engines, this would not be an issue, because the redundant writes are ignored. But on PostgreSQL engines, it is another story; here it would actually carry out the writes, leading to a potentially high number of redundant iops when the engine is vaccuming outdated records. With this change, the SQL update will only affect the rows which is not in the desired state already.

- Support alternate hashing algorithms for client secrets ([ddba42f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ddba42f49837c48d4ee9bf9203ffa81f3b31757c)), closes [rfc6819#section-5](https://github.com/rfc6819/issues/section-5) [/datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819#section-5](https://github.com//datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819/issues/section-5):

  This patch adds support for hashing client secrets using pbkdf2 instead of bcrypt, which might be a more appropriate algorithm in certain settings. As we assume that most environments fall in this category, we also changed the default to pbkdf2 with 25.000 rounds (roughly 1-3ms per hash on an Apple M1 Max core).

  High hash costs are needed when hashing user-chosen passwords, as users often reuse passwords across sites. A high hash cost will make it much harder for the attacker to guess the user-chosen password and try using it on other sites (e.g. Google).

  As most client secrets are auto-generated, using high hash costs is not useful. The password (OAuth2 Client Secret) is not user chosen and unlikely to be reused. As such, there is little point in using excessive hash costs to protect users. High hash costs in a system like Ory Hydra will cause high CPU costs from mostly automated traffic (OAuth2 Client interactions). It has also been a point of critizism from some who wish for better RPS on specific endpoints.

  Other systems like Keycloak do not [hash client secrets at all](https://groups.google.com/g/keycloak-dev/c/TmsNfnol0_g), referencing more secure authentication mechanisms such as assertion-based client authentication.

      <h2>v1.11.10 (2022-08-25)</h2>
      <pre>This release resolves a critical regression introduced in Ory Hydra v1.11.9. Upgrade to this version and skip Ory Hydra v1.11.9 if you have an existing system. The bug can break existing refresh tokens from working.

It includes no other significant changes.

### Bug Fixes

- Improve refresh webhook getter ([d40b1da](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d40b1daf2b62cd9868032fa1c376e1301936c0e1))
- Omit null lifespans ([#3212](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3212)) ([2d080a0](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/2d080a01dc39a3f7155cf05938501d59bc5f21bb))
- Regression in session store ([5c4321d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5c4321d8d605c5c09537e345f56b447ac5856f95))
- Remove special char from snapshot symbols ([7128ad2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/7128ad2a066674c4c1252f2cb1619055e5fbbbd9))
- Revert config changes ([4da64de](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/4da64de7502a4de8cca4db6cfa35bdcf485ba7ef))
- Session unmarshalling ([3bb943a](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/3bb943a9ac2d4309b43d1cb9bf27bac7cabb86f9))

### Code Generation

- Pin v1.11.10 release commit ([1a6c220](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/1a6c22070fc9550796c14b271e816be1dd1b8d78))

      <h2>RETRACTED - v1.11.9 (2022-08-01)</h2>
      <pre>☠️ WARNING ☠️

This version contains a regression which can cause the refresh flow to fail for existing consent sessions. Please do not upgrade to this version. For new systems, you can still use this version.

---

This release introduces two new features:

- The ability to specify token lifespans on a per-client basis using a new HTTP endpoint;
- The additional context in the refresh token hook.

### Bug Fixes

- Backport fix for client specific CORS ([#1754](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1754)) ([#3163](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3163)) ([996258d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/996258d50ec620c89a8f55a98436320ab99db62b))
- **docs:** Correct the tracing service name environment variable ([6e2343c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6e2343c68fb662b4af3839f56acff4f85c428f79)):

  While I believe this used to be specific to OTEL, it now appears to be
  configurable "globally", according to `spec/config.json`.

- Fixed configuration editor for the documentation page ([#3105](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3105)) ([0a77a06](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/0a77a069a9d3c7bea425694da44ac1cfbc37923a)):

  Closes https://github.com/ory/docs/issues/722

- Handle server error when refresh token requests come same time ([#3207](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3207)) ([e66ba3c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/e66ba3c6b3277e5be772f786df26509f939840e7))
- Link OIDC Certification image ([#3124](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3124)) ([17b517f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/17b517f355f63788b237b2964984df02b56b8c63))
- Ping logic for SQL Registry ([#3095](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3095)) ([a383b5a](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a383b5a655688b203aba49c35c0f9c3cda84483d)), closes [#2734](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2734)
- Swagger for dynamic client registration ([#3141](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3141)) ([9902ec7](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/9902ec7333c6e2d271f47f8fc93c43176282d180))
- Updated process ending instructions ([#3176](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3176)) ([b72491e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b72491ec81dc61ebf5d52ec0f30ae4561f37f9df)):

  cmd + c doesn't end the process on macOS but ctrl + c does.

### Code Generation

- Pin v1.11.9 release commit ([8814e79](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8814e7979cad87e454c1d68bb0eb758e28ab9473))

### Documentation

- Fix missing image ([7925597](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/79255970787c4793a57fe79d756aa0364b4a9490))

### Features

- Add session and requester to refresh token webhook data ([#3204](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3204)) ([6d23859](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6d23859009dafc8b8f51d0feec04b850c137e19a)), closes [#3203](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3203)
- Add token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg to cli ([#3148](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3148)) ([ed6eb30](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ed6eb3017dfb82f1c1fa97f1d88d023211f1e034))
- Custom client token ttl ([#3206](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3206)) ([9544c03](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/9544c03a3bc62de88f5348db30db2f6651c69597)), closes [#3157](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3157):

  This change introduces a new endpoint that allows you to control how long client tokens last. Now you can configure the lifespan for each valid combination of Client, GrantType, and TokenType.

### Code Generation

- Pin v1.11.8 release commit ([337ab3e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/337ab3ec2e363292ff93d5e5641a9b0bb87dba0c))

### Documentation

- Update pricing ([c46f780](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c46f780f4d736a325e63d4542ed3dfbe83431ae6))
- Update README ([#3032](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3032)) ([980c2d8](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/980c2d843acc70a23a71dc9b4347d13d70dbc399))

### Features

- Add hsm key set prefix to support multiple hydra instances on the same hsm partition ([#3066](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3066)) ([90523fd](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/90523fd0d31930666bd091efeb9346498d92978e)):

  This pull request adds configuration option `hsm.key_set_prefix` to support multiple Ory Hydra instances to store keys on the same HSM partition. For example if `hsm.key_set_prefix=app1.` then key set `hydra.openid.id-token` would be generated/requested/deleted on HSM with `CKA_LABEL=app1.hydra.openid.id-token`

  This will not affect Hydra API in any way. `GET /keys/hydra.openid.id-token` will return key set from HSM with label `app1.hydra.openid.id-token`.

- Add support for trust grants that can issue tokens for any subject ([#3012](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3012)) ([a3c4304](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a3c4304be2d3988843084d871aa5066d36803219)), closes [#2930](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2930):

  Previously, a trust relationship had to be setup for every subject
  before the issuer could sign a JWT token for it. This change will allow
  setting up token services that can issue tokens with any value in the
  subject field.

- Async backchannel logout ([#2849](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2849)) ([22e1ebb](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/22e1ebb5742477e924ebac83c711bec08bffd7ba))
- Backchannel request logging ([#3067](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3067)) ([6dda48d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6dda48dc3e2eb6d4f57e41abcc8b49e71c38e80d))
- Make sensitive log value redaction text configurable ([#3040](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3040)) ([536352c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/536352c15bb054f123e9d62944690a06cff86ba0))

### Tests

- Ensure generator checks are executed ([#3061](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/3061)) ([d38f6e6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d38f6e626baef00cb4cf57cbe59c7b15bea76e06))

    <section>
      <h2>v1.11.0 (2022-01-21)</h2>
      <pre>Happy new year! We are excited to announce to you the next iteration of Ory Hydra: Version 1.11.0!

This version has significant new features contributed by the awesome Open Source Community - you! But not only that:

**Ory Hydra 2.0 is coming!**

While a major version, we intend to keep all APIs with as few breaking changes as possible. The efforts focus on some long-standing issues in the persistence layer. In particular, data growth rate and performance improvements are the focus areas! If you are interested to see what is going on, check out PR [#2796](https://github.com/ory/hydra/pull/2796)

And Ory Hydra 2.0 will be available as an API in Ory Cloud! If you are interested in Ory Cloud, apply to [Ory Acceleration Program](https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1KWJxgKzNQWOjR9r5blC41wextgn) and receive a **one-year free subscription for Ory Cloud's Start-Up plan**. The Start-Up plan comes with convenient features such as custom domains and unlimited identities/tokens!

More on timelines and Ory Hydra 2.0 plans will follow later this year.

If these changes are not exciting enough already, Ory Hydra now supports loading Private and Public Keys from Hardware Security Modules, a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication, and other cryptographic functions. Thank you [@aarmam](https://github.com/aarmam) for this amazing work! For more information, please [read the guide](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/next/guides/hsm-support).

Next up, Ory Hydra now natively supports the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration and OAuth2 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol which can be enabled (optionally) in the configuration! Thank you [@fjvierap](https://github.com/fjvierap) for your hard work!

We do not stop there, [@Xopek](https://github.com/Xopek) and [@jagobagascon](https://github.com/jagobagascon) added the Support for JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grants (RFC7523) to Ory Hydra! This major improvement allows Ory Hydra to have an even better integration API than before!

For our Apple users and everyone eyeballing ARM64, we now distributed binaries and Docker Images for all platforms and CPU architectures, including Apple M1, Linux ARM (v6, v7, v8, ARM64), and - this is new - FreeBSD!

Lastly, we resolved a bug in the configuration loading which now allows loading complex configuration keys from environment variables without hassle!

**Please notice that this release requires SQL migrations to be applied! As always, please make a backup before applying them!**

## Breaking Changes

To celebrate this change, we cleaned up the ways you install Ory software. There is now one central brew / bash curl repository:

```patch
-brew install ory/hydra/hydra
+brew install ory/tap/hydra

-bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/kratos/master/install.sh)
+bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/meta/master/install.sh) hydra
```

Endpoint `PUT /clients` now returns a 404 error when the OAuth2 Client to be updated does not exist. It returned 401 previously. This change requires you to run SQL migrations!

  This fix addresses an issue where configuration values in arrays could not be loaded from environment variables, which is now possible. For more information on how Ory Hydra parses configuration, [head over to the documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/configuring/)!

  Additionally, this PR resolves a build issue on FreeBSD - making it now possible to compile Ory Hydra with the FreeBSD target.

  Lastly, this change adds OpenTelemetry support!

  This change introduces support for Hardware Security Modules, a physical computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, performs encryption and decryption functions for digital signatures, strong authentication, and other cryptographic functions.

  If enabled, the Hardware Security Module is used to look up any keys. If no key is found, the software module is used as a fallback for lookup. This allows you to use the HSM for privileged keys, and the software module to manage lifecycle keys (e.g. for Token Exchange).

  For more information, please [read the guide](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/next/guides/hsm-support).

  Thank you to [aarmam](https://github.com/aarmam) for this great contribution!

      <h2>v1.10.3 (2021-07-14)</h2>
      <pre>Ory Hydra v0.10.3 brings several bug fixes and configuration features, in particular:

1. Adding the `hydra keys import` command;
2. Passing the `client_id` in the logout request;
3. Resolving prometheus cardinality issues;
4. Moving to `go-jose` for JSON Web Keys and JSON Web Tokens;
5. Supporting PKCE discovery in `/.well-known/`;
6. Support for Instana tracing.

For a full list of changes, please check below!

### Bug Fixes

- Add RFC 8414 pkce info to OpenID Connect Discovery ([#2547](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2547)) ([9693168](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/96931685da3b01b1b43c5286c6b5025ff505e50a)), closes [#2311](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2311)
- Add the missing keys import command ([#2521](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2521)) ([c4bc248](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c4bc248b3fc6bc147b0d703e7bcba3ae7ddc399e)), closes [#2520](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2520)
- Audience should include client ID ([#2455](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2455)) ([8c70394](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8c703945e91fed257432d63a1c1340a5af021e8a))
- Build issues ([5de255b](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/5de255b09ea308a10d004055f5145a80430ee4b4))
- Correct CodeFromRemote syntax ([#2626](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2626)) ([d3ee859](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/d3ee8598316f5b71f6c3dff021d57026f700b538))
- Intro docs ([#2602](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2602)) ([bc87822](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/bc8782247314835653303d147ad74a416507006e))
- No more windows workaround ([#2632](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2632)) ([db73b44](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/db73b441916ea11713b5ebde9aafb60f7a9e426d)), closes [#2160](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2160)
- **oauth2:** Enforce assertion check on userinfo aud field ([#2524](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2524)) ([c463d9f](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/c463d9f8932f36857fd539b1221868ebaee0e736)):

  This is so the check on the `ok` variable is effectual. Prior to this patch the type assertion on the *client.Client was setting the value of `ok`. Due to the fact the type assertion on *client.Client is already checked and on a false value it exits the func, this value will _always_ be true.

- Prometheus URL label ([#2503](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2503)) ([f588ec6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f588ec69d4fa03f602d3cbb20abd4188195a7375)), closes [#2502](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2502)

      <h2>v1.10.2 (2021-05-04)</h2>
      <pre>This maintenance release resolves regressions introduced in Ory Hydra v1.10.1. A big change is that Ory Hydra now supports PATCH operations for OAuth2 Clients and is able to handle TLS for admin and public endpoints individually. The breaking changes included in this release address two bugs which are marked as a BREAKING CHANGE. We believe however that these changes do not affect running systems and given the major improvements introduced by the fixes, we decided to mark this as a patch release.

## [1.10.2](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.10.1...v1.10.2) (2021-05-04)


### Bug Fixes

* CookieStore MaxAge value ([#2485](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2485)) ([#2488](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2488)) ([aafc901](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/aafc901eb09cd26e1c11f2204f46fc1d67517b92)):

    > CookieStore MaxAge is set to 86400 * 30 by default. This prevents secure cookies retrieval with expiration > 30 days. MaxAge: 0 disables MaxAge check by SecureCookie, thus allowing sessions lasting > 30 days.
* Do not use error_hint anymore ([#2450](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2450)) ([ff90c47](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ff90c47ff52c30ffeb0f9740b870be0f5313fd04))

* Version schema ([#2427](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2427)) ([7781215](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/77812158ec414bc1529a7503bcd8d1fe84dfff4d))

    > same as https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1220
* Fix uppercase id ([8ac186c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/8ac186c207a4f50aaf929ddaf6349c5055cac92e))

### Features

* Add the MaxTagValueLength config for jaeger of tracing ([#2482](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2482)) ([03c96ee](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/03c96ee22d781939a3fe9cf01763da44242a2308)), closes [#2447](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2447)

    > Implements a new endpoint `PATCH /clients/{id}` which uses JSON Patch syntax to update an OAuth2 client partially. This removes the need to do `PUT /clients/{id}` with the full OAuth2 Client in the payload.
    > 
    > 
* Split TLS config into admin and public interfaces ([#2476](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2476)) ([60704d4](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/60704d490c46840ccad966b3d0ef074913285fab)), closes [#1231](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1231) [#1962](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1962):

    > Adds the possibility to specify TLS certificates for admin and public endpoints individually. Also improves compatibility for internal networks (e.g. Kubernetes) by removing the need for having TLS termination on admin endpoints. This can be enabled by setting `serve.admin.tls.enabled` to false.


### BREAKING CHANGES

* This patch makes it so that already handled consent/login/logout requests respond with 410 Gone instead of 409 Conflict. Additionally, a URL is included that the user should be redirected to!

Co-authored-by: hackerman <3372410+aeneasr@users.noreply.github.com>
* This patch changes how issuer and public URLs are used. Please be aware that going forward, the public URL is used for redirects. Previously, the issuer URL was used. If no public URL is set, the issuer URL will be used as before.

      <h2>v1.10.1 (2021-03-25)</h2>
      <pre>We are excited to announce Ory Hydra v1.10.0!

This release adds significant data management improvements. As such, we introduce the new "hydra janitor" command which cleans up stale data and can be run, for example, as a (Kubernetes) CronJob.

The new janitor command is able to clean up invalid and expired access and refresh tokens as well as login and consent requests. This solves issues observed in installations with lots of traffic.

This patch refactors the internal file embed system by migrating to Go 1.16, simplifying and speeding up the build process.

To follow OAuth2 best-practice, refresh tokens will now invalidate the whole access and refresh token chain if reused.



## [1.10.1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/compare/v1.9.2...v1.10.1) (2021-03-25)


### Bug Fixes

* Add docs/node_modules make target ([b302501](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b302501b60da8263617966201eab5e99c733481e))
* Add network specific error message to avoid confusion ([#2367](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2367)) ([56d71e6](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/56d71e67c4b985f03bc374faf998543b5bb21221)), closes [#2338](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2338)

    > Move from viper to koanf caused env vars without corresponding
    > paths in config.schema.json to be ignored. This commit adds
    > missing sqa section, so the SQA_OPT_OUT env var has effect again.
* Adopt new cli renderer pipeline ([02483ce](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/02483ce4c00d53d897830a2aaa7ff0a6d540dc3a))

* Fix subject identifier algorithms to match configuration ([#2400](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2400)) ([dd19b86](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/dd19b86b015decdfda456289cd970c70f45f3270)):

    > On https://www.ory.sh/hydra/docs/reference/configuration/ under 'subject identifiers' the name for defining which subject identifier algorithms are supported it is called "supported_types", not "enabled" as in these pages.
* Improve readme tests section ([#2380](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2380)) ([277afe9](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/277afe9d1a191ad3b2ec21e5197ecc09146def61))
* Quickstart config ([#2328](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2328)) ([f20f645](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f20f645998cadd066a3d027ceb78002b340442b9))
* Update config.schema.json default values ([#2348](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2348)) ([8494822](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/849482209b6f270dfd7965a1f3d6de39feb3cd58)):

    > Updated wrong config schema values
* Update examples to new helm install command format ([#2369](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2369)) ([f006556](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f006556f584a63009af5117c449a52d11aa72a14)):

    > Tried example with helm 3.5.2 and it does not support `--name` flag. So I moved name and repository to first line of commands.


### Features

* Add --no-shutdown flag to "hydra token user" to prevent auto-termination ([#2382](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2382)) ([#2386](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2386)) ([a17d10e](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/a17d10e7c273069e9cac18a9ea0326200bc2b569))
* Add front/backchannel logout params to client cli ([#2387](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2387)) ([055f801](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/055f801eb76e187b3fa70e6a474d68a0d56f766b)), closes [#1487](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1487)
* Flush inactive/expired login and consent requests ([#2381](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2381)) ([f039ebb](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/f039ebbdf315715deb44fc20fb3fdef3f4fa7b51)), closes [#1574](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1574):

    > This patch resolves various table growth issues caused by expired/inactive login and consent flows never being purged from the database.
    > 
    > You may now use the new `hydra janitor` command to remove access & refresh tokens and login & consent requests which are no longer valid or used. The command follows the `notAfter` safe-guard approach to ensure records needed to be kept are not deleted.
    > 
    > To learn more, please use `hydra help janitor`.
    > 
    > This patch phases out the `/oauth2/flush` endpoint as the janitor is better suited for background tasks, is easier to run in a targeted fashion (e.g. as a singleton job), and does not cause HTTP timeouts.
* Flush refresh tokens for service oauth2/flush ([#2373](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2373)) ([b46a14c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/b46a14cd6d260a7dee748de34abfea54908f1a0b)), closes [/github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1574#issuecomment-736684327](https://github.com//github.com/ory/hydra/issues/1574/issues/issuecomment-736684327)
* Move to go 1.16 and static embed files ([6fa591c](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/6fa591c849c3d63b036d7a4001496f42f02b821b))
* Refresh token reuse detection ([#2383](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2383)) ([bc349f1](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/bc349f1fbaf19340081d9a6c097de2b76e848e46)), closes [#2022](https://github.com/ory/hydra/issues/2022):

    > This patch adds support for Refresh Token reuse Detection introduced by https://github.com/ory/fosite/pull/567. Ory Hydra's persister no longer deletes refresh tokens when using them, but instead deactivates them - similar to how authorization codes work.


### Tests

* Resolve migration regression ([e59e2bc](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/e59e2bc9eb58b9bbf14d5e591ebaf04b7de19c6d))
* Use cypress fetchers ([2aa0980](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/2aa09804f670e4f24d8ee7df7feae94b12394ee3))
* Use go 1.16 in conformity ([ccd983d](https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/ccd983d707fd6b98f848f1206e151a44fcfc3b51))


### Unclassified
