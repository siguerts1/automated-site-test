      <h2>Ray-2.44.0 (2025-03-21)</h2>
      <pre># Release Highlights

- This release features Ray Compiled Graph (beta). Ray Compiled Graph gives you a classic Ray Core-like API, but with (1) less than 50us system overhead for workloads that repeatedly execute the same task graph; and (2) native support for GPU-GPU communication via NCCL. Ray Compiled Graph APIs simplify high-performance multi-GPU workloads such as LLM inference and training. The beta release refines the API, enhances stability, and adds or improves features like visualization, profiling and experimental GPU compute/computation overlap. For more information, refer to Ray documentation: https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/compiled-graph/ray-compiled-graph.html
- The experimental Ray Workflows library has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Ray. Ray Workflows has been marked experimental since its inception and hasn‚Äôt been maintained due to the Ray team focusing on other priorities. If you are using Ray Workflows, we recommend pinning your Ray version to 2.44.

      <h2>Ray-2.43.0 (2025-02-27)</h2>
      <pre># Highlights
- This release features new modules in Ray Serve and Ray Data for integration with large language models, marking the first step of addressing [#50639](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/50639). Existing Ray Data and Ray Serve have limited support for LLM deployments, where users have to manually configure and manage the underlying LLM engine. In this release, we offer APIs for both batch inference and serving of LLMs within Ray in `ray.data.llm` and `ray.serve.llm`. See the below notes for more details. These APIs are marked as **alpha** -- meaning they may change in future releases without a deprecation period.
- Ray Train V2 is available to try starting in Ray 2.43! Run your next Ray Train job with the `RAY_TRAIN_V2_ENABLED=1` environment variable. See [the migration guide](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/49454) for more information.
- A new integration with `uv run` that allows easily specifying Python dependencies for both driver and workers in a consistent way and enables quick iterations for development of Ray applications ([#50160](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/50160), [50462](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/50462)), check out our [blog post](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/uv-ray-pain-free-python-dependencies-in-clusters)

# Ray Libraries<a id="ray-libraries"></a>

## Ray Data<a id="ray-data"></a>
üéâ New Features:
- *Ray Data LLM*: We are introducing a new module in Ray Data for batch inference with LLMs (currently marked as **alpha**). It offers a new `Processor` abstraction that interoperates with existing Ray Data pipelines. This abstraction can be configured two ways:
  - Using the `vLLMEngineProcessorConfig`, which configures vLLM to load model replicas for high throughput model inference
  - Using the `HttpRequestProcessorConfig`, which sends HTTP requests to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint for inference. 
  - Documentation for these features can be [found here.](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/data/working-with-llms.html)
- Implement accurate memory accounting for `UnionOperator` ([#50436](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/50436))

      <h2>Ray-2.10.0 (2024-03-21)</h2>
      <pre># Release Highlights<a id="release-highlights"></a>
Ray 2.10 release brings important stability improvements and enhancements to Ray Data, with Ray Data becoming generally available (GA).

- [Data] Ray Data becomes generally available with stability improvements in streaming execution, reading and writing data, better tasks concurrency control, and debuggability improvement with dashboard, logging and metrics visualization.
- [RLlib] ‚Äú**New API Stack**‚Äù officially announced as alpha for PPO and SAC.
- [Serve] Added a default autoscaling policy set via `num_replicas=‚Äùauto‚Äù` ([#42613](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42613)).
- [Serve] Added support for active load shedding via `max_queued_requests` ([#42950](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42950)).
- [Serve] Added replica queue length caching to the DeploymentHandle scheduler ([#42943](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/42943)).
  - This should improve overhead in the Serve proxy and handles.
  - `max_ongoing_requests (max_concurrent_queries)` is also now strictly enforced ([#42947](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42947)).
  - If you see any issues, please report them on GitHub and you can disable this behavior by setting: `RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_QUEUE_LENGTH_CACHE=0`.
- [Serve] Renamed the following parameters. Each of the old names will be supported for another release before removal.
  - `max_concurrent_queries` -> `max_ongoing_requests`
  - `target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica` -> `target_ongoing_requests`
  - `downscale_smoothing_factor` -> `downscaling_factor`
  - `upscale_smoothing_factor` -> `upscaling_factor`
- [Core] [Autoscaler v2](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/cluster/kubernetes/user-guides/configuring-autoscaling.html#kuberay-autoscaler-v2) is in alpha and can be tried out with Kuberay. It has improved observability and stability compared to v1.
- [Train] Added support for accelerator types via `ScalingConfig(accelerator_type)`.
- [Train] Revamped the `XGBoostTrainer` and `LightGBMTrainer` to no longer depend on `xgboost_ray` and `lightgbm_ray`. A new, more flexible API will be released in a future release.
- [Train/Tune] Refactored local staging directory to remove the need for `local_dir` and `RAY_AIR_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR`.

- [Lightning] Fix resuming from checkpoint when using `RayFSDPStrategy` (#43594)
- [Lightning] Fix deadlock in `RayTrainReportCallback` (#42751)
- [Transformers] Fix checkpoint reporting behavior when `get_latest_checkpoint` returns None (#42953)

üìñ Documentation:

- Enhance docstring and user guides for `train_loop_config` (#43691)
- Clarify in `ray.train.report` docstring that it is not a barrier (#42422)
- Improve documentation for `prepare_data_loader` shuffle behavior and `set_epoch` (#41807)

üèó Architecture refactoring:

- Simplify XGBoost and LightGBM Trainer integrations. Implemented `XGBoostTrainer` and `LightGBMTrainer` as `DataParallelTrainer`. Removed dependency on `xgboost_ray` and `lightgbm_ray`. (#42111, #42767, #43244, #43424)
- Refactor local staging directory to remove the need for `local_dir` and `RAY_AIR_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR`. Add isolation between driver and distributed worker artifacts so that large files written by workers are not uploaded implicitly. Results are now only written to `storage_path`, rather than having another copy in the user‚Äôs home directory (`~/ray_results`). (#43369, #43403, #43689)
- Split overloaded `ray.train.torch.get_device` into another `get_devices` API for multi-GPU worker setup (#42314)

- Minor documentation fixes (#42118, #41982)

üèó Architecture refactoring:

- Refactor local staging directory to remove the need for `local_dir` and `RAY_AIR_LOCAL_CACHE_DIR`. Add isolation between driver and distributed worker artifacts so that large files written by workers are not uploaded implicitly. Results are now only written to `storage_path`, rather than having another copy in the user‚Äôs home directory (`~/ray_results`). (#43369, #43403, #43689)

## Ray Serve<a id="ray-serve"></a>

üéâ New Features:

- Added support for active load shedding via `max_queued_requests` ([#42950](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42950)).
- Added a default autoscaling policy set via `num_replicas=‚Äùauto‚Äù` ([#42613](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42613)).

üèó API Changes:

- Renamed the following parameters. Each of the old names will be supported for another release before removal.
  - `max_concurrent_queries` to `max_ongoing_requests`
  - `target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica` to `target_ongoing_requests`
  - `downscale_smoothing_factor` to `downscaling_factor`
  - `upscale_smoothing_factor` to `upscaling_factor`
- **WARNING**: the following default values will change in Ray 2.11:
  - Default for `max_ongoing_requests` will change from 100 to 5.
  - Default for `target_ongoing_requests` will change from 1 to 2.

üí´ Enhancements:

- Add `RAY_SERVE_LOG_ENCODING` env to set the global logging behavior for Serve ([#42781](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/42781)).
- Config Serve's gRPC proxy to allow large payload ([#43114](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43114)).
- Add blocking flag to serve.run() ([#43227](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43227)).
- Add actor id and worker id to Serve structured logs ([#43725](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43725)).
- Added replica queue length caching to the DeploymentHandle scheduler ([#42943](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/42943)).
  - This should improve overhead in the Serve proxy and handles.
  - `max_ongoing_requests` (`max_concurrent_queries`) is also now strictly enforced ([#42947](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42947)).
  - If you see any issues, please report them on GitHub and you can disable this behavior by setting: `RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_QUEUE_LENGTH_CACHE=0`.
- Autoscaling metrics (tracking ongoing and queued metrics) are now collected at deployment handles by default instead of at the Serve replicas ([#42578](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/42578)).
  - This means you can now set `max_ongoing_requests=1` for autoscaling deployments and still upscale properly, because requests queued at handles are properly taken into account for autoscaling.
  - You should expect deployments to upscale more aggressively during bursty traffic, because requests will likely queue up at handles during bursts of traffic.
  - If you see any issues, please report them on GitHub and you can switch back to the old method of collecting metrics by setting the environment variable `RAY_SERVE_COLLECT_AUTOSCALING_METRICS_ON_HANDLE=0`
- Improved the downscaling behavior of smoothing_factor for low numbers of replicas ([#42612](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42612)).
- Various logging improvements ([#43707](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43707), [#43708](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43708), [#43629](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43629), [#43557](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43557)).
- During in-place upgrades or when replicas become unhealthy, Serve will no longer wait for old replicas to gracefully terminate before starting new ones ([#43187](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43187)). New replicas will be eagerly started to satisfy the target number of healthy replicas.
  - This new behavior is on by default and can be turned off by setting `RAY_SERVE_EAGERLY_START_REPLACEMENT_REPLICAS=0`

üî® Fixes:

- Fix deployment route prefix override by default route prefix from serve run cli ([#43805](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43805)).
- Fixed a bug causing batch methods to hang upon cancellation ([#42593](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42593)).
- Unpinned FastAPI dependency version ([#42711](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/42711)).
- Delay proxy marking itself as healthy until it has routes from the controller ([#43076](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/43076)).
- Fixed an issue where multiplexed deployments could go into infinite backoff ([#43965](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/43965)).
- Silence noisy `KeyError` on disconnects ([#43713](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43713)).
- Fixed the prometheus counter metrics emitted as gauge bug ([#43795](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43795), [#43901](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43901)).
  - All the serve counter metrics are emitted as counters with _total suffix. The old gauge metrics are still emitted for compatibility.

üìñ Documentation:

- Update serve logging config docs ([#43483](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/43483)).
- Added documentation for `max_replicas_per_node` ([#42743](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/42743)).

## Ray Serve<a id="ray-serve"></a>

üéâ New Features:
- Introduce logging config so that users can set different logging parameters for different applications & deployments.
- Added gRPC context object into gRPC deployments for user to set custom code and details back to the client.
- Introduce a runtime environment feature that allows running applications in different containers with different images. This feature is experimental and a new guide can be found in the Serve docs.

üí´ Enhancements:
- Explicitly handle gRPC proxy task cancellation when the client dropped a request to not waste compute resources.¬†
- Enable async `__del__` in the deployment to execute custom clean up steps.
- Make Ray Serve compatible with Pydantic versions <2.0.0 and >=2.5.0.

üî® Fixes:
- Fixed gRPC proxy streaming request latency metrics to include the entire lifecycle of the request, including the time to consume the generator.
- Fixed gRPC proxy timeout request status from CANCELLED to DEADLINE_EXCEEDED.
- Fixed previously Serve shutdown spamming log files with logs for each event loop to only log once on shutdown.
- Fixed issue during batch requests when a request is dropped, the batch loop will be killed and not processed any future requests.
- Updating replica log filenames to only include POSIX-compliant characters (removed the ‚Äú#‚Äù character).
- Replicas will now be gracefully shut down after being marked unhealthy due to health check failures instead of being force killed.
  - This behavior can be toggled using the environment variable RAY_SERVE_FORCE_STOP_UNHEALTHY_REPLICAS=1, but this is planned to be removed in the near future. If you rely on this behavior, please file an issue on github.
