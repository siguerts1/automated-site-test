## What's Changed
* Datetime widget fixes and improvements by @martinjagodic in https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/pull/7261
* don't display the current date by default or when the field is empty
* add `default: '{{now}}'` option to enable the current behavior of displaying the current time (using the specified format)
* add UTC indicator when `picker_utc: true`
* improve how `Z` in format and `picker_utc: true` work together
* reorder format importance: if `format` is set, `date_format` and `time_format` (if strings) are ignored 

**BREAKING CHANGE**: The datetime field is empty by default, from now on, but it was prefilled with the current date until now. Use `default: '{{now}}'` to prefill the field with the current date.
