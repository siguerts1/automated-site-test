      <h2>Developer Update - August 2024 (2024-09-16)</h2>
      <pre>Supabase kicked off Launch Week 12 in August with a Postgres+AI drop that went viral followed by other exciting announcements throughout the week. Here’s all the juicy highlights you don’t want to miss:

## Day 1 - postgres.new: In-browser Postgres with an AI interface

![postgres.new](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/august2024/postgres-new.png)

Supabase launched [postgres.new](https://supabase.link/postgres-new) which reimagines interacting with Postgres using a large language model (LLM) all in the browser. Spin up as many databases as you want, and with the help of an AI assistant, generate tables with sample data or import your data, database migrations, embeddings for semantic search and RAG, reports and charts, and so much more.

[Website](https://supabase.link/postgres-new) | [Blog Post](https://supabase.link/postgres-new-blog) | [Video Announcement](https://supabase.link/postgres-new-video)

## Day 2 - Supabase Realtime: Broadcast and Presence Authorization

![supabase realtime broadcast and presence authz](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/august2024/authz.png)

Realtime introduced Broadcast and Presence Authorization to give you fine-grain control over which clients are authorized to join private [Channels](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/concepts#channels) and what type of Broadcast and Presence actions those clients within the Channels can execute. Get started by writing row-level security (RLS) policies to dictate, as an example, that Client1 can only send messages while Client2 can only receives messages when they’re both in the same private Channel.

[Docs](https://supabase.link/realtime-authz-docs) | [Blog Post](https://supabase.link/realtime-authz-blog) | [Video Announcement](https://supabase.link/realtime-authz-video)

## Day 3 - Supabase Auth: Bring-your-own Auth0, Cognito, or Firebase

![supabase auth byo auth0, cognito, or firebase](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/august2024/auth.png)

As much as we want you to migrate over to Supabase Auth, we’re not hurt if you want to stay with your current auth provider. I’m sure you have your reasons. That’s why we’ve launched Firebase Auth, Auth0, and Amazon Cognito support so you can bring your auth and it’ll seamlessly work with the rest of Supabase. We’ve also extended multi-factor authentication (MFA) to support both SMS and WhatsApp and introduced Auth Hooks so you can customize your Supabase Auth flow.

[Docs](https://supabase.link/auth-tpa-docs) | [Blog Post](https://supabase.link/auth-tpa-blog) | [Video Announcement](https://supabase.link/auth-tpa-video)

## Day 4 - Introducing Log Drains

![supabase log drains](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/august2024/logdrains.png)

Supabase generates a ton of logs for every product and we provide a Logs Explorer for you to query them. However, we realize that you may want to send them elsewhere for various purposes. We’re not offended; we actually encourage you to do so with the release of Log Drains. You can now send your logs to external destinations like Datadog and via custom HTTP endpoints and we have more destinations in the works like Syslog and Loki.

[Docs](https://supabase.link/log-drains-docs) | [Blog Post](https://supabase.link/log-drains-blog) | [Video Announcement](https://supabase.link/log-drains-video)

## Day 5 - Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers with Wasm

![supabase fdw with wasm](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/august2024/fdw.png)

Supabase Wrappers has released several official Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW), all written in Rust, so you can query data from the likes of S3, Clickhouse, and Stripe. There are many, many data sources out there so we developed WebAssembly (Wasm) support to enable anyone to create FDWs as long as they are familiar with a language that compiles to WebAssembly and can even share their FDWs with the community. Head over to our [Catalog](https://fdw.dev/catalog/) to check Official and Community FDWs, including Snowflake and Paddle Wasm Wrappers.

      <pre>Claim your ticket for Launch Week 12 kicking off August 12 and read on to learn about a number of new features we have to share with you for the month.

## Launch Week 12

![Launch Week 12 Ticket](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/july2024/LW12-BSOD.png?t=2024-08-06T22%3A44%3A28.751Z)

Join us August 12-16 for our next Launch Week event. We will be announcing a number of new features and giving away some great swag!

[Claim Your Ticket](https://supabase.link/email-july-24-lw)

## Disable Data API for Your Project

![Disable Data API](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/july2024/disable_data_api.png?t=2024-08-06T18%3A49%3A20.047Z)

You can now disable the Data API when creating a new project with a setting under "Advanced Options". This option bolsters the security of your data by preventing unintentional access from clients. You can change this behavior on an existing project via the project's <a href="https://supabase.link/email-july-24-api-settings">API Settings</a>.

<a href="https://supabase.link/email-july-24-doc-hardening-data-api">Docs</a>

## Custom Schema for Data API

![Custom Schema for Data API](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/july2024/dedicated_schema.png?t=2024-08-06T18%3A49%3A45.505Z)

Your project's Data API exposes the public schema by default, the most commonly used schema, and can lead to unintentional access to your data. Now, you can dictate which custom schema to expose via the Data API for better security and granular control.

<a href="https://supabase.link/email-july-24-doc-hardening-data-api-schema">Docs</a>

## Save Money With Hourly Storage Billing

![Hourly Storage Billing](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/july2024/hourly_storage.png?t=2024-08-06T18%3A51%3A57.631Z)

On August 20, 2024, Supabase is changing billing for Storage from daily to hourly for new customers and gradually rolling it out for existing customers shortly thereafter. There are no billing changes for projects who continue to use Storage for the entire month while projects using Branching or Storage for partial months will see a reduction in their bill.

## Deploy More Functions at No Extra Cost

We have increased the number of Edge Functions across all plans at no extra cost and removed usage-based billing to simplify your bill.

      <h2>Developer Updates - May 2024 (2024-06-18)</h2>
      <pre>Supabase underwent Consolidation Month™ to focus on initiatives that improve the stability, scalability, and security of our products. We also have exciting product announcements that we can’t wait to share. Let’s dive in!

## Consolidation Month™

We kicked off Consolidation Month (no it’s not actually trademarked) during the month of May. During this time, every product team within Supabase addressed outstanding performance and stability issues of existing features. Here’s a small subset of initiatives and product announcements as part of Consolidation Month: 

## Auth Launches @supabase/ssr for Better SSR Framework Support

![Auth Launches @supabase/ssr](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/may2024/auth_launcher_better_SSR.jpg?t=2024-06-18T02%3A13%3A54.164Z)

The newly released @supabase/ssr package improves cookie management, developer experience, and handling of edge cases in various SSR and CSR contexts. We’ve added extensive testing to prevent issues that users experienced with the @supabase/auth-helpers package.

[Announcement](https://supabase.link/auth-ssr-email)

## pgvector v0.7.0 Release Features Significant Performance Improvements

![pgvector v0.7.0 Release](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/may2024/pgvector_v070.jpg?t=2024-06-18T02%3A16%3A29.754Z)

pgvector v0.7.0 introduced float16 vectors that further improve HNSW build times by 30% while reducing shared memory and disk space by 50% when both index and underlying table use 16-bit float. The latest version also adds sparse and bit vectors as well as L1, Hamming, and Jaccard distance functions.

[Announcement](https://supabase.link/pgvector-v070-github)

## Edge Functions Improves Memory Handling

![Functions Memory Handling](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/may2024/edge_functions_improvements.jpg?t=2024-06-18T02%3A18%3A05.014Z)

The Edge Functions team has significantly reduced the error rate for functions encountering memory issues by implementing better safeguards. This has greatly minimized errors with the 502 status code. Additionally, status codes and limits are now documented separately.

[Status Codes](https://supabase.link/functions-codes-github) | [Limits](https://supabase.link/functions-limits-github)

## Dashboard Supports Bigger Workloads as Projects Grow

![Dashboard Supports Bigger Workloads](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/may2024/dashboard_workloads.jpg?t=2024-06-18T02%3A19%3A39.432Z)

The Supabase Dashboard is now better equipped to handle your projects, regardless of their size. We have implemented sensible defaults for the amount of data rendered and returned in the Table and SQL Editors to prevent browser performance issues while maintaining a snappy user experience.

[Announcement](https://supabase.link/dashboard-workloads-email)

## Realtime Standardizes Error Codes

![Realtime Error Codes](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/may2024/realtime_standardized_error_codes.jpg?t=2024-06-18T02%3A21%3A16.200Z)

Realtime now emits standardized error codes, providing descriptions of their meanings and suggested actions. This enhancement improves your error-handling code and helps to narrow down whether the issue lies with the database, Realtime service, or client error.

[Realtime Error Codes](https://supabase.link/realtime-codes-github)

## RLS AI Assistant v2

![RLS AI Assistant v2](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/may2024/RLS_AI_Assistant.jpg?t=2024-06-18T02%3A30%3A33.913Z)

We’ve improved the prompt and output of our RLS AI Assistant by including best practices found in our RLS docs and upgrading to OpenAI’s newest GPT-4o. We’ve also introduced numerous test scenarios to make sure you’re getting the right security and performance recommendations by comparing parsed SQL with the help of pg_query.

      <h2>Developer Updates - April 2024 (2024-05-08)</h2>
      <pre>Here’s everything we shipped during our [GA week](https://supabase.link/ga-week-gh):

## Day 1 - Supabase is officially launching into General Availability (GA)

![Day 1 - Supabase is officially launching into General Availability (GA)](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/april2024/day-1-ga-update.png?t=2024-05-07T23%3A53%3A29.231Z)

Supabase has moved to General Availability (GA) with over 1 million databases under management and over 2,500 databases launched daily. We’ve been production ready for years and now we are fully confident that we can help every customer become successful, from weekend projects to enterprise initiatives at organizations like Mozilla, 1Password, and PwC.

[Full announcement](https://supabase.link/ga-gh) | [Video announcement](https://supabase.link/ga-yt) | [X space](https://supabase.link/ga-x-space)

## Day 2 - Supabase Functions now supports AI models

![Day 2 - Supabase Functions now supports AI models](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/april2024/day-2-functions-ai.png?t=2024-05-08T00%3A09%3A34.531Z)

Supabase Functions has added a native API that makes it easy to run AI models within your functions while removing nasty cold starts. You can use the `gte-small` embedding model to generate text embeddings or bring your own Ollama server to tap into many more embedding models and Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama3 and Mistral. Soon we’ll provide hosted Ollama servers so you won’t have to manage them yourselves for a more seamless experience.

## Day 3 - Supabase Auth now supports Anonymous sign-ins

![Day 3 - Supabase Auth now supports Anonymous sign-ins](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/april2024/day-3-auth-anon.png?t=2024-05-08T00%3A21%3A26.274Z)

Supabase Auth heard your requests and went to work building anonymous sign-ins which enable you to create temporary users that have yet to sign up for your application. This lowers the friction for visitors to use your application while making it easy to convert them to permanent users once they’re hooked.

## Increased Supavisor connection pooler limits

![Increased Supavisor connection pooler limits](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/march2024/supavisor-increased-connection-limits.jpg?t=2024-04-05T21%3A48%3A02.612Z)

We’ve increased the Supavisor client connection limits, the number of concurrent clients that can connect to your project’s pooler, for projects on Small, Medium, Large, and XL compute instances while pricing remains unchanged.

[Announcement](https://supabase.link/8z8fX0f)

## Conversational AI assistant now available in SQL Editor

![Conversational AI assistant in SQL Editor](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/march2024/sql-editor-conversational-ai-assistant.jpg)

Introducing a conversational AI assistant in the SQL Editor to help you write and iterate on your queries. This is currently under a feature preview and can be enabled with instructions [here](https://supabase.link/Os3jpYP).

[Announcement](https://supabase.link/Os3jpYP)

## Supavisor pooler port 6543 is transaction-mode only

![Supavisor pooler port 6543 is transaction-mode only](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/march2024/supavisor-port-6543-transaction-only.png)

We’re simplifying Supavisor connection pooler ports and modes so that port 6543 is only transaction mode and port 5432 continues to be only session mode. If you have pool mode set to session we recommend you switch to pooler port 5432 and set the mode to transaction.

## Migration to v2 platform architecture

![v2 platform architecture migration](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/march2024/supabase-v2-arch-migration.png?t=2024-04-05T22%3A03%3A00.953Z)

You may have noticed improved performance from your database over the last couple of weeks. We made some architectural changes to free up resources for your Postgres instance by removing Storage, Realtime, and Pgbouncer from your instance and each are replaced with an equivalent multi-tenant solution, including our new Supavisor connection pooler.

      <h2>March Beta 2021 (2021-04-06)</h2>
      <pre>Launch week, Storage, Supabase CLI, Connection Pooling, Supabase UI, and Pricing. Here's what we released last month.

This is also available as a [blog post](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/04/06/supabase-beta-march-2021) and a [video demo](https://youtu.be/TtLxxaYE1rA).


## Supabase Storage

Need to store images, audio, and video clips? Well now you can do it on [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/03/30/supabase-storage). It's backed by S3 and our new [OSS storage API](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api) written in Fastify and Typescript. Read the [full blog post](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/03/30/supabase-storage).

![ph-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/113680011-ff098c80-96f2-11eb-8cba-e19630ca02aa.png)



## Connection Pooling

The Supabase API already handles Connection Pooling, but if you're connecting to your database directly (for example, with Prisma) we now [bundle PgBouncer](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/04/02/supabase-pgbouncer). Read the [full blog post](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/04/02/supabase-pgbouncer).

## React UI Component Library

We open sourced our internal UI component library, so that anyone can use and contribute to the Supabase aesthetic. It lives at [ui.supabase.io](https://ui.supabase.io/) . It was also the #1 Product of the Day [on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/supabase-ui).

![supabase-ui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/113680095-16e11080-96f3-11eb-960a-b569e034e444.png)

## CLI

Now you can run Supabase locally in the terminal with `supabase start`. We have done some preliminary work on [diff-based schema migrations](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/03/31/supabase-cli#migrations), and added some new tooling for self-hosting Supabase with Docker. [Blog post here](https://supabase.io/new/blog/2021/03/31/supabase-cli).

![supabase-cli](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/113680121-1cd6f180-96f3-11eb-8aa4-930347d83eb0.png)


## OAuth Scopes

Thanks to a comunity contribution ([@_mateomorris](https://twitter.com/_mateomorris) and [@Beamanator](https://twitter.com/Beamanator)), Supabase Auth now includes OAuth scopes. These allow you to request elevated access during login. For example, you may want to request access to a list of Repositories when users log in with GitHub. Check out the [Documentation](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup#sign-up-with-scopes).

![oauth-scopes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/113680272-3ed07400-96f3-11eb-8703-09b47d849b4b.png)


## Kaizen

- You can now manage your PostgREST configuration inside the Dashboard.
- Our website has been redesigned. Check out our new [Homepage](https://supabase.io/) and [Blog](https://supabase.io/blog), and our new  [Database](https://supabase.io/database), [Auth](https://supabase.io/auth), and [Storage](https://supabase.io/storage) product pages.
- We refactored some of our Filter methods to make them even easier to use. Check out the [Full Text Search](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/textsearch) refactor.

### Kaizen

- We filled up our [Examples](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/examples) page with a lot of new content.
- We released a [Docker Compose](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml) file for running Supabase locally. This will be used in our upcoming CLI.

## Count functionality

Anyone who has worked with Firebase long enough has become frustrated over the [lack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49979714/how-to-get-count-of-documents-in-a-collection) of `count` functionality. This isn't a problem with PostgreSQL! Our libraries now have support for PostgREST's [exact](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html?highlight=count#exact-count), [planned](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html?highlight=count#planned-count), and [estimated](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html?highlight=count#estimated-count) counts. A massive thanks to [@dshukertjr](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/issues/94#event-4210564301) for this adding support to our client library.

## New Auth Providers

We enabled 2 new Auth providers - Facebook and Azure. Thanks to [@Levet](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/54) for the Azure plugin, and once again to [Netlify's amazing work](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue/issues/107) with GoTrue to implement Facebook.

![Supabase now supports Azure and Facebook Oauth providers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/106548272-a7f80780-6549-11eb-98c7-930d105351ea.png)


## Auth Audit Trail

We have exposed the audit trail directly in the dashboard, as well as the GoTrue logs. Great for security and debugging.

## Auth UI widget

In case our Auth endpoints aren't easy enough already, we've built a React [Auth Widget](http://ui.supabase.com/?path=/story/auth-auth--default) for you to drop into your app and to get up-and-running in minutes. 


![Supabase has released a React Auth widget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/106548318-bf36f500-6549-11eb-8286-487ec177b91a.png)


## New `auth.email()` function

We added a helper function for extracting the logged in user's email address. 

![Supabase added an email function for using with Policies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/106548346-ceb63e00-6549-11eb-89a1-ff134b6bd243.png)


## New Regions

Launch your database in London or Sydney!

## Copy rows as Markdown

You can now copy SQL results as Markdown - super useful for adding to blogs and issues.

![Copy query results as markdown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/106548425-eb527600-6549-11eb-8227-513c18bfa4a1.gif)



## React server components

If you're excited by React Server components then check out the Supabase + Server Components experimental repo. [https://github.com/supabase/next-server-components](https://github.com/supabase/next-server-components)


![Use supabase with React Server components](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/106548523-1ccb4180-654a-11eb-9149-c27b3d085909.png)


## Learn

We know that Auth can be a bit daunting when you're just starting out, so we have created some intro videos to get you up to speed in no time:

- [Supabase Auth Deep Dive Part 1: JWTs](https://youtu.be/v3Exg5YpJvE)
- [Supabase Auth Deep Dive Part 2: Restrict Table Access](https://youtu.be/qY_iQ10IUhs)
- [Supabase Auth Deep Dive Part 3: User Based Access Policies](https://youtu.be/0LvCOlELs5U)


## Kaizen

- Performance: We migrated all of our subdomains to Route53, implementing custom Let's Encrypt certs for your APIs. As a result, our read benchmarks are measuring up 12% faster.
- Performance: We upgrade your databases to the new [GP3](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-new-amazon-ebs-general-purpose-volumes-gp3/) storage for faster and more consistent throughput.</pre>

      <h2>Alpha October 2020 (2020-11-03)</h2>
      <pre>We're now 8 months into building Supabase. We're focused on performance, stability, and reliability but that hasn't prevented us from shipping some great features.

This is also available as a [blog post](https://supabase.io/blog/2020/11/02/supabase-alpha-october-2020) and a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gNDMMsUPI0).

### Supabase.js 1.0

In the lead-up to our Beta launch, we've [released](https://supabase.io/blog/2020/10/30/improved-dx) `supabase-js` version 1.0 and it comes with some major Developer Experience improvements. We received a lot of feedback from the community and we've incorporated it into our client libraries for our 1.0 release.

Check out the [blog post](https://supabase.io/blog/2020/10/30/improved-dx) to learn more.

### More powerful SQL Editor

Although it was only intended to be a temporary feature, the SQL Editor has become one of the most useful features of Supabase. This month we decided to make give it some attention, adding Tabs and making it full-screen. This is the first of many updates, we've got some exciting things planned for the SQL Editor.

![This image shows a SQL Editor with tabs. Originally our SQL editor was very basic, but we're moving towards something very powerful.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/97948387-62e9fb00-1dcb-11eb-9b29-4258dd0e6ea9.png)


### Keyboard shortcuts for Power Users

For the heavy table editor users, we've gone ahead and added a bunch of key commands and keyboard shortcuts so you can zip around and manipulate your tables faster than ever. 

![This image shows some of the keyboard shortcuts we introduced on the table editor.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/97948660-32569100-1dcc-11eb-95b4-233324c6e6ad.png)


### Magic Links

One of the most requested Auth features was the ability to send magic links that your users can use to log in. You can use this with new or existing users, and alongside passwords or stand alone.

![This image shows a template where developers can edit the magic links email which is sent to their users on sign up.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/97948557-e9064180-1dcb-11eb-981b-271d73837626.png)


### Kaizen

- We have new and improved [docs](https://supabase.io/docs/client/supabase-client).
- We converted [realtime-js](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js/) to TypeScript.
- Dashboard Performance: we heavily optimised our dashboard routes.
- With the help of the community, we [closed a lot of issues](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/projects/5) during Hacktoberfest.
- We have started [benchmarking](https://github.com/supabase/benchmarks) all the open source tools we use. We'll publish the results this month.</pre>

### GitHub Discussions

Supabase was given access to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions)! This is the place for you to ask questions or show off what you've built with Supabase.

![This is a screenshot of our GitHub Discussions, a new feature by GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/95417467-b3567000-0967-11eb-84ed-ad10a85cb98c.png)

### Kaizen

- Our dashboard now uses [Next.js automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) - so it should be noticeably more responsive.
- We created an Isomorphic [`gotrue-js`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/) TypeScript library for interacting with Netlify's [GoTrue server](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue). This will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`
- We migrated our [`postgrest-js`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/) library to TypeScript, and it will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`</pre>

We're 6 months into building our hosted database platform and we've made some major improvements to our auth system and table view.


## Easily create tables 

Set up tables and columns directly from the table view.

![Create tables from the dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/92347178-bf99a400-f101-11ea-8ac8-10462d608d80.gif)


## Invite your team

You can now invite team members to your organisation.

![Invite team members to Supabase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/92347197-cb856600-f101-11ea-95f6-f3aa90373336.gif)


## Auth: Email Confirmations

You can now enable Email Confirmations for new users. This can be toggled on or off and the template for this email can be edited via the dashboard. 

![Email templates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/92347203-d8a25500-f101-11ea-9ed9-49054665c6a6.gif)



## Typescript support

The biggest communty contribution to date, [@thorwebdev](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev) added Typescript support to Supabase. He even [live streamed the process](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev/status/1292722189788016641).

![This gif shows how TypeScript makes it even easier to use Supabase, through VSCode's intellisense](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/92347208-e22bbd00-f101-11ea-935a-a0414183bdd0.gif)


## Kaizen

We have a number of small improvements:

- supabase-js now has [UMD support](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/156)
- We significantly [improved our docs](https://supabase.io/docs). Try out the new search!
- All of our awesome sponsors are now listed [on our OSS page](https://supabase.io/oss).</pre>

      <h2>Alpha July 2020 (2020-08-05)</h2>
      <pre># Supabase July Alpha Updates

This is also available as a full [blog post](https://supabase.io/blog/2020/08/02/supabase-alpha-july-2020) with videos.


After 5 months of building, we're releasing one of our most anticipated features: Supabase Auth. 


## Auth

This month, we're ecstatic to announce a feature we think you'll love: Supabase Auth. It's too big to fit into a monthly update so look out for a full update in the next few days.

We want to make it easy to get started adding Auth to your app, so we've released a [simple example and a video tutorial](https://dev.to/supabase/create-a-slack-clone-with-next-js-and-supabase-3lhd) which shows you how to implement a basic auth system using PostgreSQL's Row Level Security.

## Table Editor

We've made some massive improvements to our Table Editor that we're excited to share.

#### Relationship drill down

Last month we made it easy to drill into your table relationships. This month, we make it possible to drill multiple levels deep. 

![Drill into your releationships](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/89403216-8f4d9700-d74a-11ea-9365-4f229edc8efd.png)


#### Add, delete, and download rows

We're making it easier to manipulate your data. Next month, you'll be able to add and remove columns directly from the Table view.

![Download data as a CSV](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/89403262-a096a380-d74a-11ea-9275-6ca4cca9512b.png)

## New Postgres Extensions

If you launch a new Supabase project, you'll have access to several new Postgres extensions:

- [pgsql-http](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http): HTTP client for PostgreSQL, retrieve a web page from inside the database.
- [pgjwt](https://github.com/michelp/pgjwt): PostgreSQL implementation of JSON Web Tokens
- [plpgsql_check](https://github.com/okbob/plpgsql_check): a linter tool for language PL/pgSQL
- [pljava](https://github.com/tada/pljava): write Java in your stored procedures, triggers, and functions

## Kaizen

We have a number of small improvements:

- Added Auth documentation to the auto-generated docs in each project
- Added a new `or` filter [to the client library](https://supabase.io/docs/library/get#or)
- Table View now remembers which tabs you had open.
- We have [released](https://github.com/supabase/pg-api/releases) a lot of new functionality to [pg-api](https://github.com/supabase/pg-api), a server for for managing Postgres internals via a REST interface.
- Performance: the "flash of black" which was appearing on page transition is now gone</pre>

      <h2>Alpha June 2020 (2020-07-02)</h2>
      <pre># Supabase June Alpha Updates

This is also available as a full [blog post](https://supabase.io/blog/2020/07/01/supabase-alpha-june-2020) with videos.

We're now 4 months into building [Supabase](https://supabase.com), which means another major update. Here's a few things we think you'll love in this release.


### View relational data

We're sometimes asked how we will make Postgres as simple as Firebase, since Postgres is a relational database. This month we're making our first steps to prove that relational databases can be even easier to use than document stores. We're releasing an excel-like editing interface which can drill down into your relational data.

<img width="1386" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/86233775-89531c00-bbc8-11ea-973b-40b2d0c2b51f.png"/>

### Manage JSON data

Postgres is an amazing database, giving the flexibility of a document store with the power of a RDBMS. If you use `JSON` data in Postgres, then we want to make that easy too. Supabase detects when your column is `JSON` or `JSONB`, and provides an easy way to edit and view your data. More improvements coming soon for this feature!

<img width="1386" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/86233663-59a41400-bbc8-11ea-836a-a28cce91a210.png"/>

### Choose your region

If you noticed a bit of latency on Supabase, it's because your projects were previously set up in Singapore. It was always our intention that you'd be able to choose your database region, and this month we've delivered it. In the next releases we'll even allow you to go multi-region, instantly replicating your database close to your customers.

<img width="1386" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/86233841-9bcd5580-bbc8-11ea-9cc9-eaee309c8384.png"/>

### Backups

A guiding principle at Supabase is zero lock-in. So this month we are exposing your daily database backups on the dashboard, giving you a simple way to migrate off Supabase. We have a lot more to build in this space (`WAL-G!`), so watch this space.

<img width="1386" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/86233456-04680280-bbc8-11ea-988b-914902658857.png"/></pre>
