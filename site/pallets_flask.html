    <section>
      <h2>3.1.0 (2024-11-13)</h2>
      <pre>This is the Flask 3.1.0 feature release. A feature release may include new features, remove previously deprecated code, add new deprecations, or introduce potentially breaking changes. We encourage everyone to upgrade, and to use a tool such as [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) to pin all dependencies and control upgrades. Test with warnings treated as errors to be able to adapt to deprecation warnings early.

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/Flask/3.1.0/
Changes: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/changes/#version-3-1-0
Milestone: https://github.com/pallets/flask/milestone/33?closed=1

- Drop support for Python 3.8. #5623
- Update minimum dependency versions to latest feature releases. Werkzeug >= 3.1, ItsDangerous >= 2.2, Blinker >= 1.9. #5624, #5633
- Provide a configuration option to control automatic option responses. #5496
- `Flask.open_resource`/`open_instance_resource` and `Blueprint.open_resource` take an `encoding` parameter to use when opening in text mode. It defaults to `utf-8`. #5504
- `Request.max_content_length` can be customized per-request instead of only through the `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` config. Added `MAX_FORM_MEMORY_SIZE` and `MAX_FORM_PARTS` config. Added documentation about resource limits to the security page. #5625
- Add support for the `Partitioned` cookie attribute (CHIPS), with the `SESSION_COOKIE_PARTITIONED` config. #5472
- `-e path` takes precedence over default `.env` and `.flaskenv` files. `load_dotenv` loads default files in addition to a path unless `load_defaults=False` is passed. #5628
- Support key rotation with the `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` config, a list of old secret keys that can still be used for unsigning. Extensions will need to add support. #5621
- Fix how setting `host_matching=True` or `subdomain_matching=False` interacts with `SERVER_NAME`. Setting `SERVER_NAME` no longer restricts requests to only that domain. #5553
- `Request.trusted_hosts` is checked during routing, and can be set through the `TRUSTED_HOSTS` config. #5636</pre>

      <h2>3.0.3 (2024-04-07)</h2>
      <pre>This is a fix release for the 3.0.x feature branch.

PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/Flask/3.0.3/
Changes: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/changes/#version-3-0-3
Milestone: https://github.com/pallets/flask/milestone/35?closed=1

-   The default `hashlib.sha1` may not be available in FIPS builds. Don't access it at import time so the developer has time to change the default. #5448
-   Don't initialize the `cli` attribute in the sansio scaffold, but rather in the `Flask` concrete class. #5270</pre>
