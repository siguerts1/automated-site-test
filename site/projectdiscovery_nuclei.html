> [!Important]
> Nuclei Templates for dynamic application security testing (DAST), which were maintained in a separate project at [fuzzing-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/fuzzing-templates), are now [being moved to the nuclei-templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/pull/9363) project. This way, they can be made available for use with the default nuclei installation with the upcoming release of the template project. These templates will be disabled as default but can be used with the `-dast` option.
