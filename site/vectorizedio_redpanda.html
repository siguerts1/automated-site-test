      <pre>## Features
* Improve the user messages when the
`topic_partitions_reserve_shard0` cluster config is used and a user tries to create a topic with more partitions than the core-based partition limit. by @pgellert in [#24461](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24461)
## Bug Fixes
* Ensure `redpanda_cloud_storage_cloud_log_size` metric consistent across all replicas. We used to update it seldomly from the leader replica only which lead to inconsistent/stale values. by @nvartolomei in [#24364](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24364)
* Fixed a bug in which sliding window compaction may become stuck on failing to build an index map for a single segment. by @WillemKauf in [#24424](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24424)
* Fixes a bug in which a segment  being rolled and closed could race, leading to a triggered `vassert`. by @WillemKauf in [#24560](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24560)
* Fixes a bug in which segments which may have tombstones in them were not considered eligible for self-compaction. by @WillemKauf in [#24500](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24500)
* Fixes a bug that could prevent topic recovery on ABS object storage when there are objects in a bucket from multiple clusters (e.g. following a whole cluster restore). by @andrwng in [#24455](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24455)
* Fixes a bug where `rpk` wasn't parsing `--help` when used alongside `--redpanda-id` in `rpk cloud <provider> byoc apply` by @r-vasquez in [#24396](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24396)

* Fixes a crash resulting from incorrect cleanup of log readers used for iceberg translation. by @bharathv in [#24576](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24576)
* Fixes a race that could prevent Iceberg translation from happening following a leadership change. by @andrwng in [#24562](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24562)
* Fixes accounting of iceberg commit lag metric that can remain erroneously high in some cases even though the translation if fully caught up. Additionally the change ensures that only partition leaders emit lag metrics while followers emit 0 lag. by @bharathv in [#24575](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24575)
* If a discrete disk is used for cloud storage cache Redpanda previously rejected writes if that disk (cache disk) was full (in degraded state).

* Beta version of Iceberg support was incorrectly classified as "enterprise only". by @oleiman in [#24443](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24443)
* Leader balancer: don't treat each core as independent and balance total number of leaders on each node as well. by @ztlpn in [#24440](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24440)
* Show leader id in `/v1/cluster/partitions` response. by @ztlpn in [#24585](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24585)
* [#24539](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/24539) Disable datalake services in recovery mode by @ztlpn in [#24549](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24549)

      <h2>v24.3.1 (2024-12-03)</h2>
      <pre>## Features
* Added support for Iceberg Topics (various improvements below)
* New REST API for mounting/unmounting topics by @mmaslankaprv in [#23167](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23167)
* adds rpk cluster storage topic mount, unmount, list-mount, status-mount, cancel-mount by @gene-redpanda in [#23575](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23575)
* Add leadership pinning: ability to set preferred racks for topic partition leaders. To configure, set `redpanda.leaders.preference` topic config property or `default_leaders_preference` cluster config property. by @ztlpn in [#23691](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23691)
* Enable `node_local_core_assignment` feature by default by @ztlpn in [#23453](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23453)
* Adds Schema Registry support for the JavaScript Data Transforms SDK by @oleiman in [#21491](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/21491)
* Adds list-mountable to allow listing mountable topics  by @gene-redpanda in [#23924](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23924)
* Adds the topic property `delete.retention.ms`, as well as the cluster property `tombstone_retention_ms`. Configuring these allow for the removal of tombstone records in compacted topics with tiered storage disabled in `redpanda`. by @WillemKauf in [#23662](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23662)
* Schema Registry: Support `normalize=true` by @BenPope in [#22519](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22519)
* Schema Registry: added support for the "verbose" query parameter on the schema compatibility checker endpoint by @pgellert in [#22877](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22877)
* Schema Registry: verbose compatibility error reporting is now supported for JSON as well by @pgellert in [#23208](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23208)
* [#17984](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/17984) Adds a new broker configuration transaction_max_timeout_ms. The configuration controls the maximum allowed user set timeout for transactions. If a client requested transaction timeout exceeds this configuration, the broker will return
an error during transactional producer initialization. This guardrail prevents hanging transactions from blocking consumer progress. The default value is 15mins. by @bharathv in [#21504](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/21504)
* rpk: Add `rpk registry mode` to manage the schema registry mode. by @r-vasquez in [#22675](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22675)

* A new metric (*cluster_features_enterprise_license_expiry_sec*) is added for easier monitoring of the enterprise license's expiry time. by @pgellert in [#23367](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23367)
* After the cluster is first formed, a trial license is automatically loaded to provide an evaluation period of enterprise features. by @pgellert in [#23893](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23893)

## Improvements

* A number of optimizations to local storage compaction. by @WillemKauf in [#23380](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23380)
* Add an LRU caching layer to Rust transform SDK Schema Registry client by @oleiman in [#19859](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/19859)
* Add support for differentiating tombstone records from empty-string value records in `rpk produce` and `rpk consume`.  by @WillemKauf in [#23264](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23264)
* Added support for Metadata API v8 by @michael-redpanda in [#22669](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22669)

* Adds a shard label to some consumer group metrics. by @ballard26 in [#23339](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23339)
* Adds support for setting schema registry connection parameters in the `rpk` stanza of `redpanda.yaml`. by @andrewstucki in [#24017](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24017)
* Adds the `cloud_storage_backend::oracle` value, and helps the `s3_client` properly configure for OCI storage. by @WillemKauf in [#22902](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22902)
* Adds the ability to configure Node UUID and ID overrides at broker startup. by @oleiman in [#22972](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22972)
* Allow `rpk cluster self-test start` to run, even in a cluster with mixed versions of `redpanda` (before and after `cloudcheck` addition in `24.2.x`). by @WillemKauf in [#21370](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/21370)
* Allows `DeleteRecords` requests from Kafka clients or `rpk topic trim-prefix` to be called with `truncation_offset <= start_offset` without returning an error. The request is instead treated as a no-op. by @WillemKauf in [#22905](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22905)
* Allows the self-test to be completely compatible with a mixed version cluster, in the case of a rolling upgrade. by @WillemKauf in [#22831](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22831)
* Deprecate `leader_balancer_mode` cluster config property. by @ztlpn in [#23780](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23780)
* Implements `@redpanda-data/transform-sdk-sr.SchemaFormat` for the WASM Transforms JS module by @oleiman in [#23164](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23164)
* Improve handling of boolean property values during a `CreateTopics` request by making parsing case-insensitive.  by @WillemKauf in [#23682](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23682)
* Improve handling of boolean values during a `CreateTopics` request by no longer silently ignoring an invalid value, instead throwing a configuration error. by @WillemKauf in [#23682](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23682)
* Improve handling of certain invalid topic configuration parameters that would lead to a timeout failure instead of a graceful error code during a `CreateTopics` request. by @WillemKauf in [#23682](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23682)
* Improve property configuration descriptions.  by @Deflaimun in [#23347](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23347)
* Minimizes data loss in recovery scenarios by @mmaslankaprv in [#24071](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/24071)
* Reduce the memory overhead of many small segments. by @rockwotj in [#22962](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22962)
* Return core assignments from health report in `/v1/cluster/partitions` admin API output. by @ztlpn in [#22695](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22695)
* Schema Registry: 5 new compatibility checks are added for protobuf (ONEOF_FIELD_REMOVED, MULTIPLE_FIELDS_MOVED_TO_ONEOF, REQUIRED_FIELD_{ADDED,REMOVED}, FIELD_NAMED_TYPE_CHANGED, MESSAGE_REMOVED) by @pgellert in [#22798](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22798)
* Schema Registry: Improve AVRO Normalization by @BenPope in [#22519](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22519)
* Schema Registry: now reports more specific error messages for Avro and Protobuf schemas when they are incompatible with earlier schemas. by @pgellert in [#22958](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22958)
* Set the default value of `topic_partitions_reserve_shard0` to zero. This means that we no longer weight shard 0 as if it has 2 more partitions than it actually has, leading to more even partition distribution in cases where the total number of partitions is close to the vCPU count. by @travisdowns in [#22841](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22841)
* The command line is now printed to the log at startup by the Redpanda process. by @travisdowns in [#22826](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22826)
* Upgrade data transforms tinygo compiler to version 0.34.0 by @rockwotj in [#23969](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23969)

* [#22666](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/22666) Allows users to query the value of a cluster property with `rpk cluster config get` using either the original property name, or any of its aliases. Whereas before, `rpk cluster config get` using a property's aliased name would return a `Property {} not found` result. by @WillemKauf in [#22674](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/22674)
* [#23038](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/23038) Schema Registry: Tolerate `null` `metadata` and `ruleSet` when registering or querying a schema by @BenPope in [#23044](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/pull/23044)
