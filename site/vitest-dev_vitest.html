      <h2>v3.0.0-beta.1 (2024-12-05)</h2>
      <pre>We decided to skip Vitest 2.2 and release Vitest 3 with support for Vite 6 instead. There will be no more Vitest 2 versions. Vitest 3 is the first version that supports Vite 6 (excluding 2.1.6). We aim to have a stable release in January.

Vitest 3 is our first step to standardising the public Node.js API. We plan to remove the experimental tag from the current APIs in Vitest 3.1 - the API will follow semver after that.
