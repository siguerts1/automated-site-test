### Deprecated and Removed Features:

**Deprecated features**

- We are deprecating image tags named for various architectures using the convention `<platform>-<arch>`. This change ensures further standardization and consistency across our software distribution.

**Removed features**

- **Platform and Architecture-Specific Images**:

    - All logic related to **Kompose** has been removed, following its deprecation in a previous version.
- **Nomad Support**:
    - All logic related to **Nomad** support has been removed after it was deprecated and subsequently removed from the client in version 2.20.

    - Portainer now supports Podman. It can be installed on Podman and manage Podman environments. Initial support includes Podman 5.x running on CentOS environments.
- **Better Kubernetes Management Experience**:
    - The Kubernetes management experience has been overhauled by relocating most of the logic from the client to the server, improving client speed and responsiveness. This update also introduces the ability to manage all Kubernetes resources via a simplified, abstracted API.

Please review the sections below for more details on deprecated and removed features included in this release.

### Deprecated and Removed Features:

# Overview of changes

Introducing the new Portainer CE 2.20.3 release. This is an STS (Short-Term Support) release.

As you gear up for the transition to Portainer CE 2.20.3, our latest STS (Short-Term Support) installment, ensuring a smooth upgrade is key. We urge you to back up your configurations via the Portainer UI beforehand. This backup acts as your safety net, ensuring you can gracefully revert to the prior version or state if the new frontier proves too wild. Additionally, pore over the release notes for catching any compatibility issues, understanding deprecated functionalities, and identifying essential tweaks to your current setup. Your diligence will pave the way for a seamless update.

A Short-Term Support release can be considered as "bleeding-edge" as it will contain the latest features and functionality we've developed. The STS releases (including this one) will go through a significant amount of pre-release testing, but there may be changes that could cause regressions and features that might see further iterations. As such, if stability is a crucial concern for your setup we wouldn't recommend deploying STS releases on production environments.

# Important Notice:

On update to this Portainer version, stacks and edge stacks will have their containers restarted after updating them. This is caused by the use of Docker Compose 2.26.1, which requires this restart.
Note: If you already updated to 2.20.0, 2.20.1 or 2.20.2 previously, stacks and edge stacks that DO NOT use relative paths may already have had their containers restarted on update of them, and you would not then see a restart again.
