      <pre>## What's Changed

* feat: string-based project support by @katerina20 in https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli/pull/714

    In string-based projects, the focus is on managing translatable content as individual strings rather than source files. In this project type, after uploading source files, Crowdin parses them into source strings. Unlike file-based projects, source files aren’t stored, and the emphasis is on managing the content at the string level. This approach is beneficial when dealing with projects that involve continuous content updates, dynamic content, or where a string-oriented structure is preferred.

### Deprecation warning ⚠️
