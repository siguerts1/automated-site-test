      <pre>**tl;dr Skip 1.18.0 and 1.18.1 and upgrade to this version instead.**

This release fixes a regression that appears in rare circumstances when using `Unmarshal` or `UnmarshalExact` to decode values onto pointers with multiple indirection (eg. pointer to a pointer, etc). The change was introduced in 1.18.0 as a means to resolve a long-standing bug when decoding environment variables to structs.

The feature is now disabled by default and can be enabled using the `viper_bind_struct` build tag. It's also considered experimental at this point, so breaking changes may be introduced in the future.

### `AutomaticEnv` works with `Unmarshal`

Previously,  environment variables that weren't bound manually or had no defaults could not be mapped by `Unmarshal`. (The problem is explained in details in this issue: #761)

#1429 introduced a solution that solves that issue.

### Minimum Go version: 1.19

Viper now requires Go 1.19

This change ensures we can stay up to date with modern practices and dependencies.

### `log/slog` support **[BREAKING]**

Viper [v1.11.0](https://github.com/spf13/viper/releases/tag/v1.11.0) added an experimental `Logger` interface to allow custom implementations (besides [jwalterweatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jwalterweatherman)).

In addition, it also exposed an experimental `WithLogger` function allowing to set a custom logger.

This release deprecates that interface in favor of [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog) released in Go 1.21.

> [!WARNING]
> `WithLogger` accepts an [*slog.Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog#Logger) from now on.

To preserve backwards compatibility with older Go versions, prior to Go 1.21 Viper accepts a [*golang.org/x/exp/slog.Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slog#Logger).

The experimental flag is removed.

### New finder implementation **[BREAKING]**

As of this release, Viper uses a new library to look for files, called [locafero](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/locafero).

The new library is better covered by tests and has been built from scratch as a general purpose file finder library.

The implementation is experimental and is hidden behind a `finder` build tag.

> [!WARNING]
> The `io/fs` based implementation (that used to be hidden behind a `finder` build tag) has been removed.
