* Implement `deprecated` field in json schema by @NeevCohen in [#9298](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/9298)
* Experimental: Add pipeline API by @adriangb in [#9459](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/9459)
* Add support for programmatic title generation by @NeevCohen in [#9183](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/9183)
* Implement `fail_fast` feature by @uriyyo in [#9708](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/9708)

### Changes

* Add warning when "alias" is set in ignored `Annotated` field by @nix010 in [#9170](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/9170)
* Support serialization of some serializable defaults in JSON schema by @sydney-runkle in [#9624](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/9624)

You can read more about our `smart` union matching logic [here](https://docs.pydantic.dev/dev/concepts/unions/#smart-mode). In some cases, if the old behavior
is desired, you can switch to `left-to-right` mode and change the order of your `Union` members.
