      <h2>v2.0.0 (2024-08-11)</h2>
      <pre>- ðŸš¨ (BREAKING) ðŸš¨ We upgraded the version of Rust used to build Volta, which drops support for older versions of glibc & Linux kernel. See [the Rust announcement from August 2022](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/08/01/Increasing-glibc-kernel-requirements.html) for details about the supported versions. Notably, this means that we no longer support CentOS 6 (#1611)
- ðŸš¨ (BREAKING) ðŸš¨ Due to costs and changes in the code signing process, we have dropped the code signing for the Windows installer. We now recommend using `winget` to install Volta on Windows (#1650)
- ðŸŽ‰ (NEW) ðŸŽ‰ We now ship a pre-built binary for ARM Linux & ARM Windows (#1696, #1801)
- Volta no longer requires Developer Mode to be enabled on Windows (#1755)
- `volta uninstall` now provides better help & error messages to describe its use and limitations (#1628, #1786)
- Volta will now use a universal binary on Mac, rather than separate Intel- & ARM-specific builds (#1635)
- Switched to installing profile scripts into `.zshenv` by default, rather than `.zshrc` (#1657)
- Added a default shim for the `yarnpkg` command, which is an alias of `yarn` (#1670)
- Added a new `--very-verbose` flag to enable even more logging (note: we haven't yet implemented much additional logging) (#1815)
- Simplified the fetching process to remove an extra network request and resolve hangs (#1812)
- Several dependency upgrades and clean-up refactors from @tottoto </pre>
