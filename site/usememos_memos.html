      <h2>v0.24.0 (2025-02-05)</h2>
      <pre>> The version includes changes to the database and API. Please be careful to upgrade, and it's recommended to back up your data first. Learn more in https://github.com/usememos/memos/compare/v0.23.1...v0.24.0.

**Shortcuts** have been introduced, allowing you to easily filter memos based on conditions like tags, visibility, and timestamps. Quickly create reusable filters with comparison, set, string, and logical operators, making it faster and more efficient to find the memos you need. For more details, check out the [documentation](https://www.usememos.com/docs/getting-started/shortcuts).

      <pre>## Upgrade overview

This release contains upgrade notes that deviate from the norm:

⚠️ Requires database migrations: `user.open_id` will be removed.

## Features

- Improved the account security with **access tokens**.

  - You can remove the access token to disable the login state from other devices;
  - You can generate access tokens to call APIs, and they can never expire;
  - ... learn more in https://usememos.com/docs/access-tokens

- Two new pages:

  - **User profile**: A separate home page for yourself.

  - **Resources with timeline view**: Display the resource according to the timeline to solve the problem of disorganization. And you can also quickly find related memos.
