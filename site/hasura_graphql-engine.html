      <h2>v2.47.0-beta.1 (2025-03-25)</h2>
      <pre>## Changelog
### Bug fixes and improvements

#### Server
- Don't attempt to `CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto` if it already exists, so users on Azure using an unprivileged Postgres user in Hasura can create the extension manually prior to startup.
- Add new `HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_NO_FAIL_ON_STARTUP` option, allowing the engine to start up normally, but with rate limiting and caching disabled,  if there are errors with redis during startup. _(Enterprise edition only)_

#### Console
- Fix connection template and Dynamic Routing settings being reset when editing database in Connection Details page.  _(Cloud / Enterprise edition only)_


#### CLI
- Add a flag `--no-transaction` to `migrate apply` command.

#### Build
- Update `libpq` version in UBI9 base image.

      <h2>v2.46.0 (2025-03-05)</h2>
      <pre>## Changelog
### Bug fixes and improvements

#### Server
- Fix an issue where Postgres reset JSON parameters to empty strings after a transaction, causing event trigger failures when executing mutations outside Hasura. The `insert_event_log` trigger function now correctly handles empty strings.
- Attempt to set Haskell runtime threads based on cgroup CPU limits, when present, for better automatic sizing in Docker and Kubernetes environments. Users with small CPU limits on servers with many cores should expect to see somewhat lower memory usage and possibly improved performance.
- Add optional `no_transaction` flag (default `false`) to `run_sql` API (Postgres)  to execute SQL statements outside transaction blocks, with support for splitting multiple statements. Useful for operations like `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.
- Fix the `hasura_active_subscriptions` metric becoming inconsistent (e.g. showing a negative value).
- Fix an issue where a source's metadata would be erased if the source was inconsistent and then a source update was performed.
- Mark remote schemas as inconsistent when type conflicts occur with the existing schema.
- Only show internal actions errors in logs if `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE` or `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_INTERNAL_ERRORS` are switched on.
- Increase upper bound of execution time metrics to 100s. _(Cloud / Enterprise edition only)_
- Add metrics `hasura_events_fetch_query_time` and `hasura_events_fetched_total`. _(Cloud / Enterprise edition only)_
- Fix metrics label for DB with non-standard URI. _(Cloud / Enterprise edition only)_

      <h2>v2.42.0 (2024-08-08)</h2>
      <pre>## Changelog

### Behaviour changes

  
- In certain circumstances, all HTTP headers were included in the set of session variables. This has now been reduced to only the session variables. This change affects a number of areas, including the HTTP logs, query validation, JWT claims, rate limiting, and accessing session variables in Kriti code.
  
- When `update_*_many` is given an empty list of updates, the result will now be an empty list, rather than an object. Previously, this meant that an empty list of updates would result in a result of the wrong type.
  
- In rare cases, sensitive headers were written to the GraphQL Engine logs. These cases are now handled correctly to avoid logging sensitive information.
  

### Bug fixes and improvements

#### Server
- Add field `ignored_client_headers` to Action definition to specify an explicit list of client headers to ignore when forwarding headers to the webhook handler.
- Add an experimental feature flag `remove_empty_subscription_responses`  to filter empty responses in subscription queries for Postgres data sources. This should reduce Hasura-to-database and Hasura-to-client network overhead for users with many streaming subscriptions seeing empty results.
- Add an experimental feature flag `no_null_unbound_variable_default` to remove unbound nullable variables with no defaults from the query, as per the [spec](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#example-704b8). 

  For example, if `$unbound: String` is not given a variable assignment, the query `update_table({ _set: { column: $unbound }})` will not update any columns.

- Quote Postgres custom scalar types in SQL. This enables using custom type names that are not just lowercase identifiers.
- Add missing `trace_id` and `span_id` fields to logs for Enterprise Classic edition (Enterprise edition only)
