      <h2>0.17.0 (2024-03-16)</h2>
      <pre>Thanks to the many contributors! Particular highlights are

Thanks to @bash's work, delta now automatically detects whether your terminal has a light/dark background (unless you specify with `--light` or `--dark`):

* Detect Dark/Light Mode from Terminal by @bash in https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/1615

@joshtriplett solved the long-standing problem of correctly parsing traditional grep output, e.g. `git grep`, `grep`, etc. Until now there had been annoying parse ambiguities related to separator characters in file paths. This is particularly valuable for `git grep` since it has interesting features such as `git grep -W` (see https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/769)

* Parse filename unambiguously using color escape sequences by @joshtriplett in https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/1634

      <h2>0.16.4 (2023-06-02)</h2>
      <pre>It's 6 months since the last release so this one brings quite a few changes. Thanks very much to all contributors, especially @nickelc for a huge number of contributions, and @wescande for his work on improving whitespace highlighting. With this release delta can now display grep output in (hopefully) exactly the same layout that ripgrep does, but adding syntax highlighting, hyperlinks, and navigation. Use `ripgrep --json ... | delta` for that, or set `grep-output-type = ripgrep` to get that output style from `git grep` etc.

This release does not contain binaries for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`, `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`, or `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` because the cross-compilation GitHub Actions jobs were broken at the time of release. I'll issue a follow-up release including them when that's fixed.

      <h2>0.12.0 (2022-02-14)</h2>
      <pre>There's quite a lot in this release, with contributions from 8 different people.

Firstly a **breaking change**: some deprecated options are no longer supported: in particular `plus-color` and `minus-color`. See https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/914. A description of this change and what you need to do if you're affected by it is below.

Secondly, **improvements**, including:

- A (much-needed) short help text is now available: use `delta -h`. Delta is the proud possessor of 100 command-line options, so I think this is going to be helpful.
- git blame output now displays line numbers (thanks to @th1000s)
- Improvements to file and mode labels by @WayneD 
- delta now has a user manual: https://dandavison.github.io/delta/. You can even create a PDF copy (print button in upper-right hand corner), and the README is correspondingly now a much easier read with the minimal required setup instructions and an overview of functionality with screenshots.

Finally some **bug fixes**, including
- File path hyperlinks (e.g. in diff and grep output) were previously sometimes incorrect, especially when delta was invoked from a directory other than the repo root.
- Some fixes to grep output parsing edge cases 

## Deprecated options no longer supported:

The options affected here have been deprecated for a couple of years; I hope this doesn't cause you any trouble. Here are the details:

The most common case is that you have something like this in your `~/.gitconfig`:
```
[delta]
    plus-color = my_plus_color
    minus-color = my_minus_color
```

Please change that to
```
[delta]
    plus-style = syntax my_plus_color
    minus-style = normal my_minus_color
```

Here's the list of deprecated options with a summary of how to update them:

```
minus-color             Deprecated: use `minus-style = normal my_background_color`
plus-color              Deprecated: Use `plus-style = syntax my_background_color`
minus-emph-color        Deprecated: use `minus-emph-style = normal my_background_color`
plus-emph-color         Deprecated: Use `plus-emph-style = syntax my_background_color`
highlight-removed       Deprecated: use `minus-style = syntax my_background_color`
commit-color            Deprecated: use `commit-style = my_foreground_color
                                         commit-decoration-style = my_foreground_color`
file-color              Deprecated: use `file-style = my_foreground_color
                                         file-decoration-style = my_foreground_color`
hunk-style              Deprecated: synonym of `hunk-header-decoration-style`
hunk-color              Deprecated: use `hunk-header-style = my_foreground_color
                                         hunk-header-decoration-style = my_foreground_color`
theme                   Deprecated: use `syntax-theme`
```

      <h2>0.11.3 (2021-12-15)</h2>
      <pre>- Fix handling of `--word-diff` and `--color-words` (#829). Note that `line-numbers` and `side-by-side` will be ignored if delta detects that the input was generated by `git --word-diff / --color-words`.
- `DELTA_FEATURES` can now be used to *add* to features specified in ~/.gitconfig. Use a `+` prefix to do this: an example is  `DELTA_FEATURES=+side-by-side` which will activate `side-by-side`, in addition to your usual features.
- Store `less` history file in a better location on Windows. Thanks @rashil2000 for this work!
- Fix performance issue affecting some linux users (#839)

      <h2>0.11.0 (2021-12-06)</h2>
      <pre>This release adds handling of merge conflicts and the "combined" diff format which git uses for merge commits; see the [Merge conflicts](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/#merge-conflicts) README section and https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/189. Please consider setting

```gitconfig
[merge]
    conflictstyle = diff3
```

With that setting, when a merge conflict is encountered, delta will display diffs between the ancestral commit and each of the two merge parents:

<table><tr><td><img width=500px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/144783121-bb549100-69d8-41b8-ac62-1704f1f7b43e.png" alt="image" /></td></tr></table>

    <section>
      <h2>0.10.3 (2021-12-03)</h2>
      <pre>- Delta was previously handling `--word-diff` and `--color-words` output in a nonsensical way. With this release, delta does not attempt to handle these output types, allowing git's raw output through unchanged. Appropriate handling may be added later. See https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/152
- When a line is unchanged but paired with a line that has additions/deletions, delta now assigns the unchanged line `{plus,minus}-non-emph-style`; previously it assigned `{plus,minus}-style`. This change does not alter visual output by default because by default those two style styles are set to the same value. See https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/785
- Fixes a bug affecting line numbers in `side-by-side` mode, see #819

      <h2>0.10.0 (2021-11-24)</h2>
      <pre>New features in this release:

- delta displays output from `git grep` and `rg --json ... | delta` with code syntax highlighting and navigate functionality. See [README#grep](https://github.com/dandavison/delta#grep) and https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/774.
- delta displays output from `git blame` with code syntax highlighting, hyperlinks to commits, and control over formatting. See [README#git-blame](https://github.com/dandavison/delta#git-blame) and https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/761.
- delta syntax highlights file contents produced by `git show $revision:/path/to/file`
- delta can apply syntax highlighting and arbitrary styling to the raw colors emitted by `git --color-moved`. This is done by specifying rules for remapping styles using `map-styles`. See below, and [README#--color-moved-support](https://github.com/dandavison/delta#--color-moved-support) and https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/72
- More powerful configuration options: styles can reference other styles, custom styles and custom colors can be defined in gitconfig and reused, and 140 colors can be specified using their standard CSS names. See below.
- New subcommand `--show-colors` outputs a demo of 140 background colors with syntax highlighting, to help choose background colors.
- New subcommand `--parse-ansi` takes color input and prints out the corresponding style strings (useful for `map-styles`)
- Utilities for interrogating the command line of the process that is sending output to delta, added by @th1000s.

Here's an example of using `map-styles` to assign delta styles (one with syntax highlighting) to the raw color-moved styles output by git. This should allow all git's color-moved options to be rendered using delta styles:

```
[delta]
    features = my-color-moved-theme

[delta "my-color-moved-theme"]
    git-moved-from-style = bold purple     # An ad-hoc named style (must end in "-style")
    
    map-styles = "my-color-moved-theme.git-moved-from-style => red #cccccc, \
                  bold cyan => syntax #cccccc"
                  
    # we could also have defined git-moved-to-style = bold cyan
```

To make use of that, you need to know that git is emitting "bold cyan" and "bold purple". But that's not always obvious. To help with that, delta now has a `--parse-ansi` mode. E.g. `git show --color=always | delta --parse-ansi` outputs something like this:

<table><tr><td><img width=300px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/143238872-58a40754-ae50-4a9e-ba72-07e330e520e6.png" alt="image" /></td></tr></table>

As you see above, we can now define named styles in gitconfig and refer to them in places where a style string is expected. We can also define custom named colors in git config, and styles can reference other styles; see the [hoopoe theme](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/master/themes.gitconfig#L76-L91) for an example:

```gitconfig
[delta "hoopoe"]
    green = "#d0ffd0"  # ad-hoc named color
    plus-style = syntax hoopoe.green  # refer to named color
    plus-non-emph-style = plus-style  # styles can reference other styles
```

Additionally, we can now use the 140 color names that are standard in CSS. Use `delta --show-colors` to get a demo of the available colors, as background colors to see how they look with syntax highlighting:

<table><tr><td><img width=300px src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/143237384-246db199-ef65-4ad2-ad4e-03d07d1ea41d.png" alt="image" /></td></tr></table>

      <pre>This is a followup to release 0.9.0 fixing a bug in the `--help` text emitted by the 0.9.0 binary (see 3aab5d19569fa52ace2d7e6d196a1256990c4e20).

0.9.0 was a major release adding line-wrapping to side-by-side mode: [0.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases/tag/0.9.0).</pre>

      <h2>0.9.0 (2021-10-27)</h2>
      <pre>With this release, long lines are wrapped in side-by-side mode, thanks to a far-reaching series of contributions by @th1000s (see https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/515). No special customization is needed, but sophisticated control over the details is available: see `--wrap-max-lines`, `--wrap-left-symbol`, `--wrap-right-symbol`, `--wrap-right-percent`, `--wrap-right-prefix-symbol`, `--inline-hint-style`.

In the image below, the long deleted line in the left panel overflows by a small amount, and the wrapped content is right-aligned in the next line. In contrast, the long replacement line in the right panel overflows by almost an entire line, and so the wrapped content is left aligned in the next line.  The arrow markers and ellipsis explain when and how text has been wrapped.

      <pre>This is mainly a bug fix release: filenames containing spaces were causing crashes due to a regression in 0.8.0. It also includes a fix for the `delta file_a file_b` "diff mode" usage style, and an improvement for the diff-highlight / diff-so-fancy emulation modes.

      <h2>0.8.0 (2021-05-28)</h2>
      <pre>- 🚀 New option `relative-paths` causes all file paths to be printed relative to the current directory so that they can be easily opened in a text editor or used in a shell command. Using `hunk-header-style = file line-number syntax` will emit the line number with the file path and thus should allow your editor to open at the correct line. For example, in the VS Code integrated terminal this means that with no further configuration every file path in git output can be opened with ctrl-click/cmd-click, and opening at a specific line works. Use `diff-stat-align-width` to control horizontal alignment of diff stat sections, although this may be replaced by a better solution in the future. https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/552
- 🚀 New option `commit-regex` allows delta to work nicely with custom `git log` formats (https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/174)
- 🚀 Support `git -c delta.foo=bar ...` in latest git version https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/573
- 🚀  Support custom hyperlink hash formats [#613](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/613)
- 🚀 Allow custom themes to be defined as light themes [#598](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/598)
- 🚀 Transform file paths to be relative to current directory [#552](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/552)
- 🚀 `delta file_A file_B` now invokes `git diff`, instead of `diff -u`
- [**Fixed**] 🐛 the --24-bit-color option is unusable from .gitconfig: `24-bit-color` is deprecated; use `true-color` instead. [#567](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/567)

      <h2>0.7.1 (2021-03-29)</h2>
      <pre>This release brings two improvements due to delta contributors:

- @cben proposed a new way for delta to seed `less` with the regexp that is used to implement navigation, which is implemented in this release. This makes it possible to keep `navigate=true` in delta config all the time, without the ill effects that it had before ([#237](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/237))
- @clnoll contributed a new option `delta --show-themes`, which demos the delta [color themes](https://github.com/dandavison/delta#custom-color-themes) that are available locally. `n` and `N` step forwards and backwards through the themes. (https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/550)
- @clnoll has also contributed new themes to the [growing collection](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/blob/master/themes.gitconfig) (please consider submitting your own color config as a theme!)

- [**closed**] 🐛 Setting $PAGER to use delta results in an infinite loop [#529](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/529)
- [**closed**] 🐛 `--navigate` breaks `git log --oneline` and empty `git diff` [#237](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/237)

    <section>
      <h2>0.6.0 (2021-02-05)</h2>
      <pre>This release brings a new and more convenient way to change delta options in a one-off git command: using `git -c`. Here's an example:

```
git -c delta.line-numbers=false -c delta.max-line-distance=0.8 show
```

Thanks to @wyuenho for pointing out that this should be supported. See https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/493 and https://github.com/dandavison/delta/pull/495.

One note: while quotes around color hex codes are required in gitconfig, they can be omitted in the `git -c` context
```
git -c delta.plus-style='syntax "#aa0000"' show
git -c delta.plus-style='syntax #aa0000' show
```

- [**closed**] 🐛 Hunk header misaligned in some cases [#510](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/510)
- [**closed**] 🐛 Delta does not respect git -c [#493](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/493)
- [**closed**] 🚀 Support for Apple Silicon/ARM64 [#484](https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/484)
