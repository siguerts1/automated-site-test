Small patch release for you all. This is mainly to fix an issue with v0.47.1 which erroneously re-indented users' lazygit config files on startup.

Shout-out to @karimkhaleel for his PR with some gnarly yaml-handling code.

And a special shout-out to @ChrisMcD1 who has been pumping out many great contributions lately. Great to have you aboard.

      <h2>v0.44.0 (2024-09-07)</h2>
      <pre>## What's Changed

Lots of great changes in this release. Thanks to everybody who contributed!

### Enhancements üî•
* Per-repo config files (and reloading of edited config files) by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3787
	* In addition to the global config file you can now create repo-specific config files in¬†`<repo>/.git/lazygit.yml`. Settings in these files override settings in the global config file. In addition, files called¬†`.lazygit.yml`¬†in any of the parent directories of a repo will also be loaded; this can be useful if you have settings that you want to apply to a group of repositories.
	* We now also automatically apply (most) config changes without the need to restart lazygit
* Easily view diff across range of commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3869
	* If you select a range of commits, we now show the diff across the range (inclusive). This makes it easy to see the total changes across a number of commits. Likewise, if you press enter when a range of commits are selected, we will show the changed files for the range.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6646c78b-5770-41c1-93b9-5442d32404de


	
* Support hyperlinks from pagers by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3825
	* If you're using delta as a pager (which I highly recommend trying), you can now click on line numbers to go to that line in your editor by using the following config:
	```yaml
	git:
	  paging:
	    colorArg: always
	    pager: delta --paging=never --line-numbers --hyperlinks --hyperlinks-file-link-format="lazygit-edit://{path}:{line}"
	```

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75fef6c4-d437-4595-ab00-b8990215cfed



* Switch to Files panel after popping/applying a stash by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3888
	* This is a nice quality of life improvement. You generally want to go straight to the files panel after you pop or apply from the stash
* Ask to auto-stage unstaged files when continuing a rebase after resolving conflicts by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3879
	* Another quality of life improvement: often you resolve some conflicts, then make another couple changes, then in lazygit you say to continue and you get an error saying there are unstaged changes. Now instead of showing an error, lazygit asks if you want to stage those changes and continue.
* Offer autostash option when creating new branch by @brandondong in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3871
	* Another great quality of life improvement
* Allow using shell aliases in interactive custom commands by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3793
* Switch tabs with panel jump keys by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3794
	* If you've already been using the number keys (1-5) for jumping to specific side panels, you'll be pleased to know that you can now also use those keys for jumping to tabs within a side panel. E.g. to go to the reflog panel, you can now press 4 to jump to the commits panel, then 4 again to go to the reflog tab.
* Rename "Custom Command" to "Shell Command" by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3800
	* There are two ways of invoking a 'custom' command in Lazygit: first by pre-defining a command in your config, and second by pressing ':' and typing in the command directly. We referred to both of these as 'custom commands' which was confusing. We now refer to the second approach as invoking a 'shell command'.
* Improve template placeholders for custom commands by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3809
	* Now you can use `SelectedCommit` to refer to the selected commit regardless of which commits panel you're in (local commits, reflog, etc)
	* Likewise, you can use `SelectedPath` whether you're in the files panel or the commit-files panel.
* feat(custom command): support multiple contexts within one command by @yam-liu in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3784
	* You can now use a comma-separated list of contexts for which a custom command can be invoked. For example:
	```yaml
	customCommands:
	  - description: 'Add empty commit'
	    key: 'E'
	    context: 'commits,files'
	```
* Improve mouse support for commit message panel by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3836
* Make auto-staging resolved conflicts optional by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3870
	* If you set `git.autoStageResolvedConflicts` to false in your config, lazygit will no longer auto-stage files in which you've resolved merge conflicts.
* Allow using `<`/`>` and `,`/`.` in sticky range select mode in patch explorer by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3837
* Add Zed editor support to editorPreset by @susl in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3886

### Fixes üîß

</pre>

    <section>
      <h2>v0.43.0 (2024-07-13)</h2>
      <pre>## What's Changed

Thanks to all contributors who helped make this release happen! There's a lot of first-time contributors on this release as well so kudos to you all.

There's quite a few things in this release. I'm going to single out a couple that have changed my workflow.

### Base branch stuff

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f50824a-6221-4ca0-9cf3-a4d45cc43262

#### Easier rebase onto base branch

_(Add command to rebase onto base branch by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3615)_

When my feature branch gets out of date with the main branch, I like to rebase it onto the main branch. Up until now, that's required:
* Navigating to the main branch
* Pressing 'f' to fast-forward it onto its upstream branch
* Pressing 'r' to rebase the checked-out branch onto the main branch

That takes too long! Now you can just press 'r' followed by 'b' to rebase onto the base branch (which defaults to origin/main).

#### See the divergence count from the base branch

_(Divergence from base branch display by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3613)_

You can now also configure to see the divergence from a branch and its base branch with the following config:
```yml
gui:
    showDivergenceFromBaseBranch: arrowAndNumber # or 'onlyArrow'
```

This shows the divergence count in blue, next to the yellow count of divergence from the upstream branch. This is admittedly noisy, so it's an opt-in feature. But I think the noise is worth it.

If you set the config value to 'onlyArrow' it's a lot less noisy:

<img width="891" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/470cb003-8fc6-4a72-aa04-6e228c49f381">

#### See detailed divergence from base branch

_(Add command to show divergence from base branch as a left-right log by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3614)_

By pressing 'u' then 'b' on a branch you can see the divergence view for that branch compared to its base branch

### Improved 'Find commit for fixup' feature

_(Improve the "Find base commit for fixup" command by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3602)_

'Find commit for fixup' is not a very catchy name for this feature but I can't think of anything better at the moment. Nevertheless! The idea is that you often want to know for a given set of changes, which commit ought they be included in? Just press `ctrl+f` when in the files panel and lazygit will jump the cursor to the appropriate commit to fixup.

With this release, the feature is smarter and more lenient so it's more likely to find you a match. If you haven't tried this out you should really give it a go!

### Other Enhancements üî•
* Add Squash merge by @noahfraiture in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3566
	* Now when you press `shift+m` you get the option to do a regular merge or a squash merge. If you already have muscle memory for regular merge; don't worry: it's the same sequence of keypresses.
* Improve "Find base commit for fixup" command when there are changes for master commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3645
* Allow setting the similarity threshold for detecting renames by @isti115 in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3025
	* For this, press ')' and '(' to increase/decrease the similarity threshold.
	

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a85825b8-9110-4090-ba89-ba8221cbc7a8


* Reduce memory consumption when loading large number of commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3687
  * 2-6x less memory usage when dealing with lots of commits. HUGE improvement.
* Focus on local commits view after moving code into new commit by @AzraelSec in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3577
* Add property outputTitle to CustomCommand by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3579
* Add user config `gui.expandedSidePanelWeight` by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3623
	* You can now increase the height of the selected side panel when you've configured the accordion effect
	```yml
	gui:
      expandFocusedSidePanel: true
      expandedSidePanelWeight: 3
    ```
    
<img width="891" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a47bd1c-67b0-4d2f-a885-56e6a07ece12">

* Support range select for amending commit attributes by @AzraelSec in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3587
	* This lets you select a range of commits and update the author / set the co-author on all of them at once.

      <h2>v0.41.0 (2024-03-23)</h2>
      <pre>Hold on tight because this is a HUGE release! This release includes a whopping 595 commits from a period of over 7 months, from 40 different contributors. Thanks to everybody who made this possible, and apologies for taking so long to actually release it: we'll be more frequent in future!

Special thanks to Stefan Haller who is behind many of this release's changes and who has been critical in getting this release across the line.

I've made a video running through the big changes here:

## What's Changed

Here's some highlighted features:

### Range select

![range-select](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif?raw=true)

You can now press 'v' to toggle range select in any list view, just like you already could in the staging view. You can also press shift+up/down to select a range. You can use range select to:
* stage/discard a range of files
* select multiple commits to fixup/squash/move outside an interactive rebase
* select multiple commits to mark as fixup/squash/etc within an interactive rebase
* select multiple commit files to discard or add to a custom patch (courtesy of @afhoffman)
* select multiple commits to cherry-pick

I have been waiting for this feature for a very long time and it's already made me way more productive. If I need to squash a range of commits I can now easily do it directly rather than needing to squash them one-by-one, or needing to manually start an interactive rebase first. Likewise, it's much easier to select a range of files and stage them than stage them one-by-one.

This is a **Breaking change**: Unfortunately, the 'v' key clashes with the existing key for pasting commits (cherry-pick), so we've replaced that with shift+V and changed the commit copy key to shift+C. If you want the old keybindings back, you can do that like so:
```yml
keybinding:
  universal:
      toggleRangeSelect: <something other than v>
    commits:
      cherryPickCopy: 'c'
      pasteCommits: 'v'
```

### Auto-wrap in commit editor 

The commit editor now automatically hard-wraps your content by default, so you no longer need to hit the enter key yourself when you approach the margin. You can disable/configure this in your config:

```yml
git:
  commit:
    autoWrapCommitMessage: true
    autoWrapWidth: 72
```

Thanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.

### Easier remote branch checkout

Now when you go to checkout a remote branch, either via the `c` keybinding in the branches view or by pressing `space` on a remote branch, you'll be given the choice to checkout as a local branch or as a detached head (previously it would just check it out as a detached head which typically isn't what you want). This is a **Breaking change** in terms of muscle memory.

Thanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.

### Easier start interactive rebase

Previously, to start an interactive rebase, you would need to navigate to a base commit and press `e` on it. Now you can simply press `i` and regardless of which commit is selected, an interactive rebase will begin that includes all the commits on your branch (or if there are merge commits: all the commits up to first merge commit). 

The above demo for range select showcases this.

### Easier squashing of `fixup!` commits

In a similar vein to the above section, now when you press `shift+S`, you're given the choice of squashing all commits above the selected commit and squashing all commits on the branch, which is what you typically want. This is a **Breaking change** in terms of muscle memory.

Thanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.

### View divergence from upstream branch

If you press `u` on a local branch a menu appears which shows options relating to the branch's upstream. Now, the first option in that menu allows you to view the divergence from the upstream which shows commits to pull and commits to push

Thanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.

### Find appropriate commit for fixup/amend

This one is some serious voodoo: if somebody suggests changes in a PR review, you'll often apply the changes, then go hunting for the appropriate commit to fixup/amend. Now, from the files view you can press `ctrl+f` and if Lazygit can identify an appropriate commit with certainty, it will select that commit for you. Pretty cool!

We've made the algorithm very strict so that you can always trust the result, but this means in circumstances where we can't know for sure which commit is appropriate (such as when your changes only include added lines), it's left to you to manually find the commit. We're keen to get lots of feedback on this feature to see where the sweet spot is.

For more info see [the docs](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Fixup_Commits.md#finding-the-commit-to-create-a-fixup-for)

Thanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.

### Delete remote branches/tags

Now when you press `d` on a local branch, remote branch, or tag, you're given the option to delete that branch/tag in the remote.

Thanks to @AzraelSec for this feature.

### Add co-author to commit

When you press `a` on a commit an option now appears to add a co-author (something GitHub can read).

Thanks to @omaussa for this feature.

### Filter commits by author

You can now filter commits by author via pressing `ctrl+s` in the commits view and selecting the option to filter by author.

Thanks to @Part22 for this feature.

### Change branch sort order

You can now change branch sort order by pressing `s` in the branches view (and remote branches view). By default local branches are sorted by 'recency' meaning how recently they were checked out, but you can now sort by head commit date and alphabetically.

Thanks to @hosaka for this feature.

### Better bare repo support

We have fixed a bunch of bugs relating to bare repos so if you had issues with them in the past it should work fine now.

Thanks to @jwhitley for this feature.

### Miscelleneous UI changes

* Unstaged files are now shown in white, not red, which is easier on the eyes
* Scrollbars are thinner (and, thus, cooler)
* Keybindings menu now has section headers (@stefanhaller) 
* Error toasts now appear for some errors (less intrusive than popups) (@stefanhaller)
* Search history is now retained (@karimkhaleel)
* Git log is shown by default (@stefanhaller) 

### More Breaking Changes üí•

* When you press 'g' to bring up the git reset menu, the 'mixed' option is now the first and default, rather than 'soft'. This is because 'mixed' is the most commonly used option.
* Push/pull/fetch loading statuses are now shown against the branch rather than in a popup. This allows you to e.g. fetch multiple branches in parallel and see the status for each branch.
* The git log graph in the commits view is now always shown by default (previously it was only shown when the view was maximised). If you find this too noisy, you can change it back via `ctrl+L` -> 'Show git graph' -> 'when maximised'
* Filtering (e.g. when pressing '/') is less fuzzy by default; it only matches substrings now. Multiple substrings can be matched by separating them with spaces. If you want to revert to the old behavior, set the following in your config:
```yml
gui:
  filterMode: 'fuzzy'
```

# üéâ  LAZYGIT FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY EDITION üéâ 

Holy moly, has it really been 5 years since Lazygit's birth? Time flies when you're having fun.

I've written a post celebrating the anniversary [here](https://jesseduffield.com/Lazygit-5-Years-On).

As for this release, we've got some great features here. 

### Worktrees

We now have a worktrees view so you can easily create worktrees and switch to them and so on. I'm not a big worktrees user myself so please raise an issue if you can think of places to improve the UX.

![worktree_create_from_branches-compressed](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/3ef0b085-e9d0-42de-af58-16cbae581d34)

### Rebase --onto

Rebasing onto a marked base commit is a very useful feature that we've been sorely lacking for a while
(demo coming soon)

### Auto-refresh on window focus

Auto-refresh on window activation is a complete game-changer. No more having to manually press shift+R when you come back from your editor.

### Nuking the worktree

We also have a fun enhancement in this release: showing an explosion animation when you nuke the working tree.

![nuke-gif](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/32b3f91c-fea3-474d-8997-1de2f5e4f5d4)

You'll also notice in the readme we've got some updated demo gifs to showoff Lazygit's features. More of those to come.

      <pre>## What's Changed
 In v0.38.0 we displayed branch markers in the compact commits view, but this caused some confusion as it wasn't very clear what the markers represented. We're going to revisit the UX for this before considering re-introducing it. If you would like to re-enable the feature, set `gui.experimentalShowBranchHeads` to `true` in the lazygit config. As the name suggests, this is experimental and we may change this config in the future.

_Most recent patch: [v0.38.2](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/tag/v0.38.2)_

We've got lots of goodies in this release. Some notable improvements are a revamped commit message panel (@seand52), much better interactive rebase behaviour (@stefanhaller), and much less error-prone custom patch behaviour (also @stefanhaller).

As you can see, @mark2185 and @Ryooooooga continue their reign as top contributors, but we are now also joined by @stefanhaller who is behind many of the big improvements in this release. I'd also like to give a special shoutout to @seand52 who's behind the revamped commit message panel. And thank you to all the other contributors who contributed towards this release: @AKARSHITJOSHI, @axieax, @AzraelSec, @humblepenguinn, @jbrains, @jenskutilek, @knutwalker, @pereBohigas, @scallaway, @shinhs0506, @ShrutiC-git, @TylerBarnes, and @yk-kd.

As always if you're interested in contributing to Lazygit, don't hesitate to pick an issue and have a Go (pardon the pun), and if you'd like to support me please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/jesseduffield).

On a more boring note intended for current/future contributors, we've now fully migrated to a new integration test pattern which makes it much easier to test your changes and prevent regressions. We've also got a huge refactor PR (https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2519) that's about to go in right after this release goes out, so if you have a PR open that now has conflicts, reach out to me (@jesseduffield) and I can help resolve them.

## Breaking changes

* 'x' no longer opens the menu, you'll need to use '?' or remap the keybinding. We did this so that we could use 'x' for destructive actions like nuking the working tree, as some people accidentally double-tapped 'D' and ... nuked their working tree)
* You can no longer use 'y' or 'n' to respond to a confirmation popup. Instead you'll need to use 'enter' or 'esc'. This is again just freeing up keybindings for more uses.
* We've changed how you configure your editor settings because it was a bit of a mess previously. See [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md#configuring-file-editing) for the new approach. You'll get deprecation warnings upon closing lazygit until adjusting your config, so that nobody gets mad when we remove support in a following release.

      <h2>v0.36.0 (2022-11-14)</h2>
      <pre>We've got a whole lot of stuff in this release: improvements to the editor, better custom commands support, snappier staging of files, a tonne of bug fixes, and lots more.

One particularly cool thing that we've added is Github codespaces support (in the repo, not within the Lazygit program itself), so if you've got your eye on an open issue and want to move things along, consider spinning up the lazygit codebase in a code_space_ and having a go at adding a feature / fixing a bug all from the comfort of your browser! See [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-in-a-github-codespace) for more info.

As you can see @Ryooooooga and @mark2185 continue to kick goals with a heap of features and bug fixes in this release, but we also have a whole host of new contributors too. If you want to get involved in contributing, you can peruse the issues board for issues with the good-first-issue label, or jump into the [Fortress of Laziness](https://discord.gg/4FhUY75c), our new discord server

      <h2>v0.35 (2022-07-20)</h2>
      <pre>## Features

* Nerd fonts now supported! (@Ryooooooga)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/179950774-ff20e6bc-1b0a-493e-9db9-86dcf2dc71aa.png)

* Scrollbars! (non-interactive but cool nonetheless)
* Diff hunks can now be edited directly (via a subprocess) (@Ryooooooga)
* You can open lazygit to the panel that you care about e.g. run `lazygit log` to open lazygit to the commits panel. (@HiromasaNojima)
* Most menus now have their own keybindings for each menu item, which should speed things up for power users.
* You can now easily set/unset the upstream of a branch (@mark2185)
* You can now select to stash exclusively unstaged/staged files (@mark2185)
* Improved update flow (@moha-gh)
* Fixed issue where we duplicated line breaks when parsing a commit message Don't duplicate line breaks when retrieving commit message (@moha-gh)
* Some hard-to-reverse actions now have confirmation popups given it's easy to accidentally press the wrong key.
* 'Gone' branches are now marked as such
* More commit attributes can be copied with the 'y' key (@mark2185)
* Custom commit author colours can now be specified with regular names (e.g. 'red') instead of only hex codes. (@Ryooooooga)
* Commit author can now be set to another author or reset to the current git user (thanks @JensPfeifle)
* Auto-refresh of files can be disabled with the `git.autoRefresh` config option (@moha-gh)
* We now (again) honour push.default config value. In general we want to err on the side of having git commands do the same thing that would happen if you ran them directly from the terminal.
* Files can now be opened from the merge conflicts panel (thanks @Ryooooooga)
* You can now configure to always show the unstaged and staged changes panels, regardless of whether the selected file has both unstaged and staged changes. This can be done via `gui.splitDiff: 'always'` (@HiromasaNojima)
* Commit time format can now be customised via the `gui.timeFormat` config key (@Ryooooooga)
* We now record the current directory on switch instead of exit (@davdroman)
* We now support Bitbucket server PRs (thanks @TheBlob42)
* Bottom line (containing some keybindings help) can now be hidden via `gui.showBottomLine: false` in your config.
* You can now show the whole git graph in the commits panel by default via `git.log.showWholeGitGraph: true`
* Some UI tweaks.

## Bug fixes
* Various fixes to bugs relating to double-width characters (@Ryooooooga)
* Typo fixes (@casswedson)
* LOTS of other bug fixes (thanks to the glorious @Ryooooooga and @mark2185)

## Translation updates:
Chinese translated updated (@Crystal-RainSlide)
Japanese translation added (@Ryooooooga)
Korean translation added (@Shin-JaeHeon)

HUGE thankyou to all the contributors who've helped bring about this release. As you can see @mark2185 and @Ryooooooga are behind many of the the changes so a special thankyou to the both of you!

## Maintenance stuff:
We've now on go1.18 meaning we can use generics. The lo package is our main generics helper package. I've also rolled my own, called 'generics', but I'll probably end up just committing to using lo only.

Integration tests in CI are now run in parallel, and windows builds are now properly cached, so CI runs much faster and you'll sooner know if you've broken a test.

## Note from maintainer:

I'm working on some tricky features like the ability to filter the contents of a list panel, some of which I've recorded on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFQFkdzh_Js&ab_channel=JesseDuffield). As part of that work I've had to make a detour to do some yak shaving and refactoring (which is happening in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2023)

I've also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNavnhzZHtk&ab_channel=JesseDuffield) showing how to add a basic feature to Lazygit for aspiring contributors. If you would like to see similar videos/docs covering other topics to make life easier for new/existing contributors, lemme know!

At some point I want to take time off work to go full-time on Lazygit (e.g. for a few months). If you have any ideas how I could raise money to do that, let me know! And of course for all those currently sponsoring, thankyou so much, it's a big motivator for me finding the time to work on this project.

Some more rambling thoughts:
* The integration test suite has some good coverage but the mechanism behind it (recording a Lazygit session and having the test replay that session) is hard to maintain. I want to switch to having integration tests be built by calling a bunch of commands in sequence, similar to Cypress if anybody's used that.
* I was holding off this release for the sake of a better in-app release notes feature but that can wait for a future release.</pre>

      <h2>v0.34 (2022-03-17)</h2>
      <pre>## Features:
* You can now customise the colour of unstaged files via the `gui.theme.unstagedChangesColor` config key (thanks @snorrwe )
* Editing a file will now open your editor at the currently selected line for most major editors (thanks @mark2185 )
* Support for opening Azure DevOps repos (thanks @tiwood )
* You can now skip the confirmation prompt after running a subprocess with the `promptToReturnFromSubprocess` config key (thanks @Rambhosale )

## Bug Fixes:
* Fixed issue where mouse handling was not properly restored after leaving the application (thanks @tmatz )
* Fixed bug where files could not be edited at particular lines for certain editors (thanks @fsmiamoto )

## Other:
* Some cleaning up of the docs (thanks @moha-gh )
* NL translation fixups (thanks @Alpakash )
* Fixed an issue with the cheatsheet generator that caused the user's own language to appear in each output translation file.

## Note from maintainer:
* I'm going to merge in quite a large refactor PR to the master branch. The refactor is about 90% done but the 10% might take some time and it's tricky to have to re-implement all PRs from contributors to the new branch. At any rate this refactor should make the code easier to work with compared to the previous god struct (the Gui struct) that was being used for everything. The new structure no doubt will have its own flaws that I'll need to work through over time. I've been using the refactor PR myself for a while and haven't run into any bugs, and I've added some more integration tests to capture more of the expected behaviour. Don't hesitate to raise an issue for any bug you find.</pre>

      <h2>v0.33 (2022-02-19)</h2>
      <pre>## Features:
* Git bisect support (press 'b' on a commit to start the process)
 
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/150614046-861138e7-be54-47f6-ab9c-b5c22ea34ff1.mov

* On windows we now set the window title to the name of the opened repo (thanks @birgersp)
* You can now set custom branch colours in your config (see [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md#custom-branch-color)) (thanks @matt-cles )

## Bug Fixes:
* We now always specify the upstream when pushing/pulling so you'll never accidentally push to an unexpected remote branch
* Fixed bug that prevented quitting with a confirm popup
* Fixed issue with scrolling in the merge panel
* We no longer show the branch graph when filtering by path because it didn't make sense to show it
* Fixed a bug where a custom git hosting service wasn't given precedent over a default hosting service (thanks @bin101)
* Added Mouse support for crostini (thanks @tmatz)
* Proper URL encoding for pull request URLs  (thanks @MikaelElkiaer)

## Other:
* Performance improvements
* We now ask for confirmation upon reverting a commit (thanks @glendsoza)
* Resetting a submodule can now only be done from within the files panel
* Documentation updates (thanks @jm33-m0, @mark2185)
* Chinese translation update (thanks @bnoctis)

## For Contributors:
* You can now run an integration test in 'sandbox' mode meaning you get to control what happens during the session but no snapshot is saved. It's a convenient way of testing a feature with a given pre-built example repo.
* I've replaced the contributor code of conduct with a very stripped down version that basically says 'be nice'. The original was a little intense and didn't reflect the natural level of charity and positivity in the issues board. If people have an issue with that let me know.
* I've added some extra sections to the contributing guide including:
  - how the codebase (intentionally) diverges from some Go idioms
  - i18n
  - testing
  - debugging


## Note from maintainer:
* Still working on this gui package refactor. I expect the health of the codebase to increase quite a bit with the change. I regret not trying to slice it up into smaller pieces but hopefully I'll have learnt my lesson next time.
* We might need to rethink how integration tests are done. Right now it's a direct recording which can make the tests difficult to update.

## For Contributors:
* CI now checks that the cheatsheet files are up-to-date. If it hasn't you'll need to run `go run scripts/cheatsheet/main.go generate`

## Note from maintainer:
The codebase has grown quite a bit since its inception and it's in need of some refactoring to make future growth easier. I've wrapped up some refactoring to the internal `commands` package so that we've got better namespacing and separation of concerns, and I'll be shifting my gaze to the GUI package next. Once I'm happy with the structure of the code I'll start producing some documentation so that new contributors can easily get started on features and bug fixes. Many changes to the app are trivial to make but it can take a new contributor time to work out where everything lives in the code.
