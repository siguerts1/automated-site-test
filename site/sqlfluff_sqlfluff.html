      <h2>[3.3.0] - 2024-12-10 (2024-12-10)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This release brings a few more significant changes. Especially given the introduction of several new rules, we highly recommend testing this release on your project before upgrading to make sure they are configured appropriately for your project style guide. As always, we have tried to make sure that the defaults for all new rules are both widely applicable, and fairly light touch. While all have been tested on some existing larger codebases which the maintainers have access to - do still report any bugs you might find on GitHub in the usual manner.

* We've dropped the `appdirs` package as a dependency (as an abandoned project) and instead added `platformdirs` instead. Users should not notice any functionality changes beyond the different dependency.
* *TWO* new dialects: _Impala_ and _StarRocks_.
* *FIVE* new rules:
  * `AM08` (`ambiguous.join_condition`), which detects `JOIN` clauses without conditions (i.e. without an `ON` or `USING` clause). These are often typos and can result in significant row count increases if unintended.
  * `CV12` (`convention.join_condition`), which is related to `AM08` and detects cases where users have used a `WHERE` clause instead of a `JOIN ... ON ...` clause to do their join conditions. The join condition is a form of metadata and should communicate to the end user how the table should be joined. By mixing this information into the `WHERE` clause it makes the SQL harder to understand.
  * `LT14` (`layout.keyword_newline`), which allows certain keywords to trigger line breaks in queries. Primarily this forces the main `SELECT` statement clauses like `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` etc. onto new lines. This rule has been designed to be highly configurable, but with sensible light-touch defaults. Check out the docs to adapt it to the conventions of your project.
  * `ST10` (`structure.constant_expression`), some SQL users include redundant expressions in their code (e.g. `WHERE tbl.col = tbl.col`). These conditions always evaluate to a constant outcome (i.e. always evaluate as `TRUE` or `FALSE`) as so add no functionality or meaning to the query. This rule catches them.
  * `ST11` (`structure.unused_join`), which detects unused joins in SQL statements, and is designed to catch tables that were once used, but where the column references have since been removed and now the table is unnecessary.

Beyond these changes, we've seen a whole host of dialect improvements to almost *all* of the supported dialects and several bugfixes which are combined into this release.

We also welcome **TWELVE** new contributors to the project in this release. Thanks to all of them for their hard work üöÄüèÜüöÄ.

      <h2>[3.2.0] - 2024-09-18 (2024-09-18)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This release brings a few minor breaking changes, both for the core project and for the dbt templater. For the main project:

* Resolving an issue with the spacing of functions (LT01), which involved a change to how functions are parsed. If your project relies on the specific parsing of functions, the bracketed arguments are now wrapped in a `function_contents` object. We recommend that you examine the new parsing structure using this new release in testing first.

* `RF06` (`references.quoting`) is now case sensitive when removing quotes which are detected as unnecessary. This rule has also been re-enabled by default for Snowflake and Postgres where it had previously been disabled (for the reason that in the past it hadn't been appropriately case sensitive). Treatment for totally case-insensitive dialects like DuckDB and SparkSQL have also been included. Please check the new documentation for this rule (which is much more explicit now), for details related to your dialect.

* Patterns equivalent to those from `.sqlfluffignore` can now be included in `.sqlfluff` and `pyproject.toml` files.

* Using the `python` templater, users now have an option to include variables which include a dot in the path, like `{{ foo.bar }}` using a special `sqlfluff` context variable.

* Significant changes under the hood to the handling of configuration files. Most of these should not be visible to end users, but for anyone integrating SQLFluff into a larger project and relying on native file loading may need to refactor their project for this release. Most notably here, for maintainers of plugins, the `ConfigLoader` class has been deprecated, and plugins should instead call the config loading functions directly. See the example plugin for details.

* Documentation, especially for dialects, has been significantly improved. Documentation for `CP02` (`capitalisation.identifiers`) has also been clarified to make it's implication for references and aliases more clear.

* During testing, to isolate the effect of specific rules, there's a new CLI option `--disable-noqa-except` which allows all `noqa` options to be ignored _except_ the ones provided in this option.

For the dbt templater:

* Support for dbt 1.1-1.3 has been removed. All have been in End of Life (EOL) support by dbtlabs for almost two years. They are also poorly supported by other projects and tools.

* The dbt templater has been migrated to use `pyproject.toml`.

* Handling of errors and exceptions raised within dbt has had an overhaul. Users may see a slightly different presentation of errors, but the overall stability should be more robust.

In addition to those changes, there have been too many dialect contributions and bugfixes  to mention specifically. We've also seen **six** people make their first contributions to the project as part of preparing for this release! üéâüèÜüéâ.

      <h2>[3.1.1] - 2024-08-20 (2024-08-20)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This release brings a bumper lot of bugfixes, dialect improvements and other minor improvements across the board. Most notably:

* A rework of the structure of the docs. **NOTE**: This does change the url of some docs pages, but to prevent future moves, we've also provided permalinks to most important pages and rules. See the `conf.py` file in the `docs` folder for a full list of permalinks.
* Solving rule conflicts between LT02 & LT02.
* Bugfixes to AM07, CV11, ST03, ST05 & RF03,
* Removes some redundant dependencies in for the dbt templater (which haven't been required for some time, but have been included in the install dependencies). Specifically: `markupsafe`, `ruamel.yaml`, `pydantic` & `rich`.
* And too many dialect improvements to summarise!

We've also seen **fifteen** new contributors to the project! Thanks to all of them for taking the time to contribute. üéâüéâüèÜüéâüéâ

      <h2>[3.1.0] - 2024-07-03 (2024-07-03)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This minor release has two breaking changes:
 - The addition of camelCase in the extended capitalisation policy. This change removes the ability to
autodetect PascalCase, from now on PascalCase, and camelCase must be explicitly set in the config if desired.
 - The detection method for sqlfluff config has changed. It should now be more consistent, regardless of how deep if the directory
structure you run the command from.

This release also brings in support for the MariaDB dialect. As well as this, there are many bugfixes,
and dialect improvements.

Thanks also to the **twelve** new contributors whose work was included
in this release! üéâüéâüèÜüéâüéâ

      <h2>[3.0.6] - 2024-05-06 (2024-05-06)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This release primarily fixes an issue introduced by the recent dbt 1.7.14 release, and better support for dbt 1.7+. It also includes a range of dialect improvements and CLI refinements.

This release also includes the groundwork for linting the unrendered sections of Jinja templates. More documentation on this will be released in due course when it's ready for beta testing.

Thanks also to [@padraic00](https://github.com/padraic00) & [@burhanyasar](https://github.com/burhanyasar) who made their first contributions in this release. üéâüéâüèÜüéâüéâ

      <pre>## Highlights

This release brings several breaking changes to previous releases. Most notably:

* It drops support for python 3.7, which reached end of life in June 2023.

* It migrates to `pyproject.toml` rather than `setup.cfg` as the python packaging configuration file (although keeping `setuptools` as the default backend).

* The serialised output for `sqlfluff lint` (and the corresponding API methods) now contains more information about the span of linting issues, initial proposed fixes and several statistics which were previously only accessible via csv export. Beside the *new* fields, the original fields of `line_pos` and `line_no` have been renamed to `start_line_pos` and `start_line_no`, to distinguish them from the new fields starting `end_*`.

* The default `annotation_level` set by the `--annotation-level` option on the `sqlfluff lint` command has been changed from `notice` to `warning`, to better distinguish linting errors from warnings, which always now have the level of `notice`. This is only relevant when using the `github-annotation` or `github-annotation-native` formats.

* A change in the default behaviour for `convention.not_equals`. The new default is to be `consistent`, which is slightly more relaxed than the original behaviour.

* The `--force` option has been deprecated on `sqlfluff fix` as that option is now the default behaviour. This is to enable significant reductions in memory overhead when linting large projects.

* The long since deprecated `--disable_progress_bar` option has been removed (which was replaced by the kabab-case `--disable-progress-bar` more than a year ago).

* Plugins are now loaded progressively, and with error handling. If a plugin fails to load, SQLFluff will now continue onward and try to run regardless while also showing a more helpful error message.

On top of these changes, there have a been a whole host of dialect improvements and additions, in particular the inclusion of a`vertica` dialect for the first time. There's also:

* A new rule (`aliasing.self_alias.column`) which prevents aliasing a column as itself.

* A change to disables AL01 (`aliasing.table`) by default for Oracle.

* A change to allow AL05 to allow aliasing for a `VALUES` clause.

For more specifics please take a look at the [release notes](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/latest/releasenotes.html).

Thanks to the community for patience during the release cycle for 3.0.0, which has taken a little longer than expected. Thanks also to the **TWENTY SEVEN** new contributors whose changes are included in this release. üéâüéâüèÜüéâüéâ

      <h2>[3.0.0a6] - 2024-03-05 (2024-03-05)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This introduces some memory optimisations in the linting operation which prevent a major cause of crashes when linting large projects. As part of that we've also deprecated the `--force` option on `sqlfluff fix` and made that the default behaviour (the associated memory optimisations will come shortly).

This also removes the long since deprecated `--disable_progress_bar` option (which was replaced by the kabab-case `--disable-progress -bar` more than a year ago).

On top of that this release also introduces the `vertica` dialect for the first time, and a whole host of bugfixes and improvements to other dialects.

This release should be considered a release candidate for the final `3.0.0` release which will follow shortly in the next few days unless any other major issues are found.

Thanks particularly to the **seven** new contributors we saw in this release üèÜüéâ.

      <h2>[3.0.0a5] - 2024-01-30 (2024-01-30)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

This release primarily brings through a large set of dialect improvements and bugfixes from over the holiday period. Notably also:

* A change in the default behaviour for `convention.not_equals`. The new default is to be `consistent`, which is slightly more relaxed than the original behaviour.
* A new rule (`aliasing.self_alias.column`) which prevents aliasing a column as itself.
* Disables `AL01` (`aliasing.table`) by default for Oracle.

This release also saw **ELEVEN** new contributors in this release üéâüéâüèÜüèÜüéâüéâ. Great to see so many new people getting involved with the project. Thank You üôè.

      <pre>## Highlights

This release makes a breaking change to the serialized output of the CLI (and by extension, any of the serialized outputs of the API).

* The serialised output for `sqlfluff lint` now contains more information about the span of linting issues and initial proposed fixes. Beside the *new* fields, the original fields of `line_pos` and `line_no` have been renamed to `start_line_pos` and `start_line_no`, to distinguish them from the new fields starting `end_*`.

* The default `annotation_level` set by the `--annotation-level` option on the `sqlfluff lint` command has been changed from `notice` to `warning`, to better distinguish linting errors from warnings, which always now have the level of `notice`. This is only relevant when using the `github-annotation` or `github-annotation-native` formats.

This release makes a couple of potentially breaking changes:

* It drops support for python 3.7, which reached end of life in June 2023.

* It migrates to `pyproject.toml` rather than `setup.cfg` as the python packaging configuration file (although keeping `setuptools` as the default backend).

Further breaking changes may be made as part of the full 3.0.0 release, but this alpha release is designed to test the new packaging changes for any issues before releasing a stable version.

This is a fairly minor release, primarily bugfixes and dialect improvements.

For python API users, there's the addition of a public method on the `FluffConfig` object allowing the construction of a config object from multiple strings to mimic the effect of nested config files in the CLI.

This release also includes a selection of internal refactoring and reorganisation to support future development work.

      <pre>## Highlights

There's a *lot* in this release. Most of it is under the covers and so shouldn't cause any breaking changes for most users. If your use case depends on some of the internals of SQLFluff, you may find some breaking changes. The bigger changes are:

- Python 3.12 support is now official (although older releases may also work as only a few changes were required for full 3.12 support).
- We've done a significant re-write of the parsing engine to remove some unnecessary segment manipulation and get us closer to "single pass" parsing. This changes the internal API being used on any `.match()` methods, and also removes the `parse_grammar` attribute on any dialect segments. We are not aware of any 3rd party libraries which rely on these APIs however and so have not triggered a more major release. These lead to significant performance improvements during parsing.
- Standardisation of terminators in the parser, and the introduction of the `ParseMode` option has enabled the removal of the `StartsWith`, `GreedyUntil` and `EphemeralSegment` parser classes.
- Several validation checks have been revised in this release, which should both improve performance (by reducing duplication), but also be more effective in preventing the application of any fixes which would result in unparsable files.

Alongside the big things this also includes a host of bugfixes, dialect improvements and CI/testing improvements.

This release also sees a bumper crop of new contributors, thanks to [@dehume](https://github.com/dehume), [@andychannery](https://github.com/andychannery), [@Kylea650](https://github.com/Kylea650), [@robin-alphasophia](https://github.com/robin-alphasophia), [@jtbg](https://github.com/jtbg), [@r-petit](https://github.com/r-petit), [@bpfaust](https://github.com/bpfaust), [@freewaydev](https://github.com/freewaydev) & [@abdel](https://github.com/abdel) who all made the first contibutions in this release! üéâüéâüéâ

      <h2>[2.3.2] - 2023-09-10 (2023-09-10)</h2>
      <pre>## Highlights

Much of this release is internal optimisations and refactoring. We're in the process of upgrading some quite old code in the parser, most of which should not be visible to end users (apart from perhaps some performance improvements!).

This release also allows missing template variables in the placeholder templater to be automatically filled with the name of the variable rather than raising an error (see: [#5101](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5101)).

Beyond that this includes some dialect improvements for DuckDB, SparkSQL, Snowflake, Redshift & Postgres.

Thanks particularly to [@shyaginuma](https://github.com/shyaginuma), [@Fullcure3](https://github.com/Fullcure3), [@adilkhanekt](https://github.com/adilkhanekt) & [@pilou-komoot](https://github.com/pilou-komoot) who made their first contributions as part of this release. üéâüéâüéâ

This release brings one new dialect, two new rules and some changes to the CLI:
- We now support the [trino](https://trino.io/) dialect. This is a first version of support, so do post any issues on GitHub in the usual way. This was also the first contribution to the project from [@efung](https://github.com/efung) üèÜ.
- `ST09` / `structure.join_condition_order`: Which checks whether tables referenced in `JOIN` clauses are referenced in the order of their definition. By default this means that in the `ON` clause, the column referencing the table in the `FROM` clause should come before the column referencing the table in the `JOIN` clause (e.g. `... FROM a JOIN b on a.c = b.c`). This rule was also the first contribution to the project from [@thibonacci](https://github.com/thibonacci) üèÜ.
- `AL08` / `aliasing.unique.column`: Which checks that column aliases and names are not repeated within the same `SELECT` clause. This is normally an error as it implies the same column has been imported twice, or that two expressions have been given the same alias.
- The `--profiler` option on `sqlfluff parse` has been removed. It was only present on the `parse` command and not `lint` or `fix`, and it is just as simple to invoke the python `cProfiler` directly.
- The `--recurse` cli option and `sqlfluff.recurse` configuration option have both been removed. They both existed purely for debugging the parser, and were never used in a production setting. The improvement in other debugging messages when unparsable sections are found means that this option is no longer necessary.

Along side these more significant changes this also includes:
- Performance optimisations for `AL04`, `AL05`, `AM04`, `RF01` & `ST05` which cumulatively may save up to 30% on the total time spend in the linting phase for some projects.
- Dialect improvements for Oracle & TSQL.
