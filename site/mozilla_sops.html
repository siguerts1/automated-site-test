      <pre>## Installation

To install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.

For instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:

```shell
# Download the binary
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.10.1/sops-v3.10.1.linux.amd64

# Move the binary in to your PATH
mv sops-v3.10.1.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
```

### Verify checksums file signature

The checksums file provided within the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:

```shell
# Download the checksums file, certificate and signature
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.10.1/sops-v3.10.1.checksums.txt
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.10.1/sops-v3.10.1.checksums.pem
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.10.1/sops-v3.10.1.checksums.sig

# Verify the checksums file
cosign verify-blob sops-v3.10.1.checksums.txt \
  --certificate sops-v3.10.1.checksums.pem \
  --signature sops-v3.10.1.checksums.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com

      <pre>## Installation

To install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.

For instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:

```shell
# Download the binary
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.linux.amd64

# Move the binary in to your PATH
mv sops-v3.9.0.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
```

### Verify checksums file signature

The checksums file provided within the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:

```shell
# Download the checksums file, certificate and signature
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.checksums.txt
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.checksums.pem
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.checksums.sig

# Verify the checksums file
cosign verify-blob sops-v3.9.0.checksums.txt \
  --certificate sops-v3.9.0.checksums.pem \
  --signature sops-v3.9.0.checksums.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

### Verify binary integrity

To verify the integrity of the downloaded binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its signature:

```shell
# Verify the binary using the checksums file
sha256sum -c sops-v3.9.0.checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

### Verify artifact provenance

The [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) link metadata file named `sops-v3.9.0.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts) tool:

```shell
# Download the metadata file
curl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.intoto.jsonl

# Verify the provenance of the artifact
slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> \
  --provenance-path sops-v3.9.0.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/getsops/sops \
  --source-tag v3.9.0
```

## Container Images

The `sops` binaries are also available as container images, based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not include these dependencies.

These container images are available for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

### GitHub Container Registry

- `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0`
- `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0-alpine`

### Quay.io

- `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0`
- `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0-alpine`

### Verify container image signature

The container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following command:

```shell
cosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  -o text
```

### Verify container image provenance

The container images include [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please refer to the [`slsa-verifier` documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#containers).

      <h2>v3.8.1 (2023-10-11)</h2>
      <pre>## Note from the Maintainers

In this release of SOPS, we have focused on landing a variety of bug fixes to improve the overall user experience.

For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to [`CHANGELOG.rst`](https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/v3.8.1/CHANGELOG.rst).

### Important Information for SOPS SDK Users

With the project transitioning from the Mozilla Foundation to the CNCF, the Go module path has been updated to reflect this change in ownership. If you use `go.mozilla.org/sops/v3` as a library, going forward, import the Go Module using `github.com/getsops/sops/v3`. Apart from this small adjustment, the SDK's API remains fully backward compatible.

For a one-liner to quickly implement this change throughout your codebase, please refer to: https://github.com/getsops/sops/issues/1246#issuecomment-1625526429

We are extremely happy to introduce this new minor release of SOPS, now a [CNCF](https://cncf.io) Sandbox project under the stewardship of a new [group of maintainers](https://github.com/getsops/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

This release involved significant effort in rewriting and enhancing key source implementations, and includes a number of bug fixes which people had been patiently waiting on for a long period of time. In addition, the release process has been built up from scratch, and now now provides enhanced assurance by publishing SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), [SLSA3 provenance attestations](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/provenance) and a Cosign signed checksums file as release artifacts.

For a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to [`CHANGELOG.rst`](https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/v3.8.0/CHANGELOG.rst).

### Important Information for SOPS SDK Users

With the project transitioning from the Mozilla Foundation to the CNCF, the Go module path has been updated to reflect this change in ownership. If you use `go.mozilla.org/sops/v3` as a library, going forward, import the Go Module using `github.com/getsops/sops/v3`. Apart from this small adjustment, the SDK's API remains fully backward compatible.

For a one-liner to quickly implement this change throughout your codebase, please refer to: https://github.com/getsops/sops/issues/1246#issuecomment-1625526429

## Installation

To install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.

For instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:

```shell
# Download the binary
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.linux.amd64

# Move the binary in to your PATH
mv sops-v3.8.0.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
```

### Verify checksums file signature

The checksums file provided within the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:

```shell
# Download the checksums file, certificate and signature
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.pem
curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.sig

# Verify the checksums file
cosign verify-blob sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt \
  --certificate sops-v3.8.0.checksums.pem \
  --signature sops-v3.8.0.checksums.sig \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

### Verify binary integrity

To verify the integrity of the downloaded binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its signature:

```shell
# Verify the binary using the checksums file
sha256sum -c sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt --ignore-missing
```

### Verify artifact provenance

The [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) link metadata file named `sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts) tool:

```shell
# Download the metadata file
curl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl

# Verify the provenance of the artifact
slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> \
  --provenance-path sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl \
  --source-uri github.com/getsops/sops \
  --source-tag v3.8.0
```

## Container Images

The `sops` binaries are also available as container images, based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not include these dependencies.

These container images are available for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

### GitHub Container Registry

- `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0`
- `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0-alpine`

### Quay.io

- `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0`
- `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0-alpine`

### Verify container image signature

The container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following command:

```shell
cosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  -o text
```

### Verify container image provenance

The container images include [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please refer to the [`slsa-verifier` documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#containers).

## Software Bill of Materials

The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each binary is accessible within the artifacts enclosed with this release. It is presented as an [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) JSON file, formatted as `<binary>.spdx.sbom.json`.

      <h2>v3.8.0-rc.1 (2023-08-25)</h2>
      <pre>## Note from the Maintainers

We're thrilled to introduce the `v3.8.0-rc.1` release candidate of SOPS, now a [CNCF](https://cncf.io) Sandbox project under the stewardship of a new [group of maintainers](https://github.com/getsops/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

This release involved significant effort in rewriting and enhancing key source implementations. Notably, we've modernized the code and updated all SDKs, including updating to AWS SDK v2. Some of these implementations had been neglected, lacking support for newer features. Now, they should be good for extended service.

Moreover, we've completely revamped the release process. Beyond delivering binaries and packages, it now provides enhanced assurance by publishing SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), [SLSA3 provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/provenance) attestation, and a Cosign signed checksums file as GitHub release artifacts.

Additionally, the Darwin binary is now distributed as a ["fat binary"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_binary#Apple), making it executable on both AMD64 and ARM64 machines.

The goal of this release candidate is primarily to validate our new release process and the quite impactful changes mentioned above. Take it for a spin and [share your thoughts](https://github.com/getsops/sops/discussions/1270), your feedback is much appreciated!
