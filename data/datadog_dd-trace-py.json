    "body": "### Upgrade Notes\r\n\r\n- Profiling\r\n  - Upgrades `echion` which includes performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### Deprecation Notes\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `patch_all` is deprecated. As an alternative to `patch_all`, you can use `import ddtrace.auto` along with `DD_PATCH_MODULES` if specific module patching is necessary.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- Dynamic Instrumentation\r\n  - Adds support for the Decimal type from the Python standard library.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Introduces a `integration` tag to LLM Observability spans that are generated by an integration.\r\n  - `agentless_enabled` and `DD_LLMOBS_AGENTLESS_ENABLED` now defaults to `None`, and will be determined automatically based on the presence of a compatible Datadog agent. `agentless_enabled` and `DD_LLMOBS_AGENTLESS_ENABLED` can still be set explicitly to `True` or `False</span>`, but is now optional for agentless users.\r\n\r\n- Profiling\r\n  - Stack v2 supports CPython 3.13.\r\n  - Adds support for native exporter on Windows.\r\n  - Enables profiling native modules for macOS x86_64.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - Adds configuration for encoding span events as a top-level field in v0.4 payloads and introduces environment variable `DD_TRACE_NATIVE_SPAN_EVENTS` (disabled by default). This requires agent version 7.63.0 or later.\r\n  - Extracts the referrer hostname from HTTP requests and stored it as `http.referrer_hostname` tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixes an issue with gevent support and the typing module on CPython >= 3.12.\r\n\r\n- ASM\r\n  - Fixes a `NotImplementedError` that occurred when trying to deepcopy wrapped builtin functions (like `open`) while ASM or IAST were enabled. The error was caused by the wrapper not implementing the `__deepcopy__` method.\r\n  - SCA: Resolves an issue where some dependencies where reported with an inaccurate name.\r\n\r\n- CI Visibility\r\n  - Resolves an issue where JUnit XML output would not count tests retried by Early Flake Detection, Auto Test Retries, and Attempt-to-Fix.\r\n\r\n- Lib-Injection\r\n  - Avoids zombie process from telemetry sender on startup.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Resolves an issue where large spans traced within a short time interval were dropped despite being under the 1 MB limit.\r\n  - Resolves an issue with anthropic LLM spans where multiple system prompts caused missing input messages.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where traces containing intermixed APM and LLM Observability spans caused incorrect parent IDs for LLM Observability spans.\r\n  - Fixes an issue where LLMObs could not be enabled in a forked process when setting `agentless_enabled=True` or `DD_LLMOBS_AGENTLESS_ENABLED=true`.\r\n  - `openai`: Avoids creating spans for streamed Open AI chat and completion requests that use `with_raw_response` since the stream cannot be traced in these cases, leading to unfinished spans.\r\n\r\n- Profiling\r\n  - Resolves an issue where the Lock profiler would throw an `AttributeError: '_ProfiledThreadingLock' object has no attribute '_self_acquired_at'`.\r\n\r\n- Single-Step Instrumentation\r\n  - Resolves an issue where using Poetry to run an application under a version of Python different from the version used to install Poetry caused automatic library injection to fail.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `graphql`: Fixes an issue in GraphQL patching that threw an error when locations (an `Optional` field) is `None`. This checks for locations before setting attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n- Single-Step Instrumentation\r\n  - Ensures that the SSI is not used for uWSGI applications. For enablement instructions, refer to the following our [advanced_usage docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#uwsgi).\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "### New Features\r\n\r\n- Includes ``dynamodb`` in the default list of cloud services for payload tagging, i.e. ``DD_TRACE_CLOUD_PAYLOAD_TAGGING_SERVICES``. Note that cloud services payload tagging feature is still gated by ``DD_TRACE_CLOUD_REQUEST_PAYLOAD_TAGGING`` and ``DD_TRACE_CLOUD_RESPONSE_PAYLOAD_TAGGING``.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability: This introduces tracing for `converse` calls to the Bedrock Converse API. `converse` calls are traced as  \r\n  LLM spans with ``max_tokens``, ``temperature`` inference parameters and input/output messages.\r\n\r\n- botocore: This introduces capturing prompts, token usage, and inference parameters for `converse` calls to the Bedrock API.\r\n\r\n- SCA: This add support for extended heartbeat every 24h with dependencies payload.\r\n\r\n- kafka: Adds messaging.destination.name tag to kafka `produce` and `consume` spans.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability: Avoids submitting spans to LLM Observability when a non-default base URL is detected in request for the Anthropic, Bedrock, LangChain, Open AI, and Azure Open AI integrations.\r\n\r\n- ASM: This introduces support for automatic instrumentation of session monitoring and blocking for Django.\r\n\r\n- ASM: This introduces new metrics span tags to keep track of truncations of WAF payloads.\r\n\r\n- runtime_metrics: Adds support for sending runtime metrics as gauge metrics (instead of distributions). To enable this feature set `DD_TRACE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES_ENABLED=DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED`.\r\n\r\n- runtime_metrics: Adds support for tagging runtime metrics with the current runtime ID. To enable tagging, set `DD_TRACE_EXPERIMENTAL_RUNTIME_ID_ENABLED=True`.\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- SCA: This fix resolves an issue where some dependencies where reported with an inaccurate name.\r\n- profiling: This fix resolves an issue where the Lock profiler would throw an `AttributeError: '_ProfiledThreadingLock' object has no attribute '_self_acquired_at'`.\r\n\r\n- tags: Updates ``DD_TAGS`` parsing to match the Datadog Agent and other SDKs. Key-value pairs can now be separated by both commas and spaces (e.g., ``DD_TAGS=\"key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3\"``). This reverts a change introduced in v2.11.0, which only allowed one separator type.\r\n\r\n- dynamic sampling: Ensures that dynamic sampling rates are always consistent with the rates received from the agent via remote configuration. Previously, setting a global sample rate and then sampling rules via remote config would result in both configurations being applied. With this fix only the most recent sampling configuration will be applied.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability: This fix resolves an issue where enabling LLM Observability caused all botocore submodules to be patched instead  \r\n  of only `bedrock-runtime`.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability: Resolves issue where Pydantic model objects were encoded as unhelpful default placeholder text.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability: Improves encoding of non-JSON serializable I/O objects by attempting to convert to string before resorting to default placeholder text.\r\n\r\n- tracing: Resolves an issue where trace information, such as span links, baggage, and trace-level tags (ex: sampling decision maker), could be lost when a new process was created while a trace was active.\r\n\r\n- internal: Fixes an issue where trimming a traceback to attach it to the span could result in the loss of the most recent frames.\r\n\r\n- pylibmc: fixes an issue where using `Client(server=[url])` would throw the error `__init__() got multiple values for argument 'servers'`\r\n\r\n- tracing: Ensures remote sampling rules no longer overwrite existing samplers, preserving service-based sample rates set by the Agent and ensuring tracer rate limits configured by ddtrace products (e.g., ASM) are always respected.\r\n### Other Changes\r\n\r\n- tracing: Ensures a single DatadogSampler is initialized per Tracer instance, improving Tracer object initialization speed by approximately 7% and simplifying sampling logic.\r\n- agent: Migrates agent connection configurations to envier. This provides better documentation and validation for expected types. The following configurations are affected:\r\n  - ``DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL``\r\n  - ``DD_DOGSTATSD_URL``\r\n  - ``DD_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME``\r\n  - ``DD_AGENT_HOST``\r\n  - ``DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT``\r\n  - ``DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT``\r\n  - ``DD_AGENT_PORT``\r\n  - ``DD_TRACE_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``\r\n\r\nOf the above impacted configurations, these had a precedence change:\r\n  - ``DD_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME`` over ``DD_AGENT_HOST``\r\n  - ``DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT`` over ``DD_AGENT_PORT``\r\n  - ``DD_DOGSTATSD_HOST`` over ``DD_AGENT_HOST``\r\n  - ``DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT`` over ``DD_AGENT_PORT``\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "### New Features\r\n- ASM\r\n  - Introduces new metrics span tags to keep track of truncations of WAF payloads.\r\n  - Introduces support for automatic instrumentation of session monitoring and blocking for Django.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Introduces tracing for `converse` calls to the Bedrock Converse API. `converse` calls are traced as LLM spans with `max_tokens`, `temperature` inference parameters and input/output messages.\r\n  - Avoids submitting spans to LLM Observability when a non-default base URL is detected in request for the Anthropic, Bedrock, LangChain, Open AI, and Azure Open AI integrations.\r\n\r\n- Telemetry\r\n  - SCA: This add support for extended heartbeat every 24h with dependencies payload.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `botocore`: Introduces capturing prompts, token usage, and inference parameters for `converse` calls to the Bedrock API.\r\n  - `kafka`: Adds messaging.destination.name tag to kafka `produce` and `consume` spans.\r\n  - runtime_metrics: Adds support for sending runtime metrics as gauge metrics (instead of distributions). To enable this feature set `DD_TRACE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES_ENABLED=DD_RUNTIME_METRICS_ENABLED`.\r\n  - runtime_metrics: Adds support for tagging runtime metrics with the current runtime ID. To enable tagging, set `DD_TRACE_EXPERIMENTAL_RUNTIME_ID_ENABLED=True`.\r\n  - Includes `dynamodb` in the default list of cloud services for payload tagging, i.e. `DD_TRACE_CLOUD_PAYLOAD_TAGGING_SERVICES`. Note that cloud services payload tagging feature is still gated by `DD_TRACE_CLOUD_REQUEST_PAYLOAD_TAGGING` and `DD_TRACE_CLOUD_RESPONSE_PAYLOAD_TAGGING`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Resolves an issue where enabling LLM Observability caused all botocore submodules to be patched instead of only `bedrock-runtime`.\r\n  - Resolves issue where Pydantic model objects were encoded as unhelpful default placeholder text.\r\n  - Improves encoding of non-JSON serializable I/O objects by attempting to convert to string before resorting to default placeholder text.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - dynamic sampling: Ensures that dynamic sampling rates are always consistent with the rates received from the agent via remote configuration. Previously, setting a global sample rate and then sampling rules via remote config would result in both configurations being applied. With this fix only the most recent sampling configuration will be applied.\r\n  - internal: Fixes an issue where trimming a traceback to attach it to the span could result in the loss of the most recent frames.\r\n  - `pylibmc`: Fixes an issue where using `Client(server=[url])` would throw the error `__init__() got multiple values for argument 'servers'`\r\n  - tags: Updates `DD_TAGS` parsing to match the Datadog Agent and other SDKs. Key-value pairs can now be separated by both commas and spaces (e.g., `DD_TAGS=\"key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3\"`). This reverts a change introduced in v2.11.0, which only allowed one separator type.\r\n  - sampling: Ensures remote sampling rules no longer overwrite existing samplers, preserving service-based sample rates set by the Agent and ensuring tracer rate limits configured by ddtrace products (e.g., ASM) are always respected.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where trace information, such as span links, baggage, and trace-level tags (ex: sampling decision maker), could be lost when a new process was created while a trace was active.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - Ensures a single DatadogSampler is initialized per Tracer instance, improving Tracer object initialization speed by approximately 7% and simplifying sampling logic.\r\n  - agent: Migrates agent connection configurations to envier. This provides better documentation and validation for expected types. The following configuration are affected:\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_AGENT_URL`\r\n    - `DD_DOGSTATSD_URL`\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME`\r\n    - `DD_AGENT_HOST`\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT`\r\n    - `DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT`\r\n    - `DD_AGENT_PORT`\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`\r\n    Of the above impacted configurations, these had a precedence change:\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_AGENT_HOSTNAME` over `DD_AGENT_HOST`\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_AGENT_PORT` over `DD_AGENT_PORT`\r\n    - `DD_DOGSTATSD_HOST` over `DD_AGENT_HOST`\r\n    - `DD_DOGSTATSD_PORT` over `DD_AGENT_PORT`\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "### New Features\r\n- Dynamic Instrumentation\r\n  - Symbol Database is now enabled by default.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Properly labels `Deepseek` for the model provider and span name for LLM Observability spans for calls to Deepseek models using the OpenAI SDK.\r\n  - Introduces an improved automated context management system for LLM Observability-specific spans. Also modifies `LLMObs.export_span()`, `LLMObs.inject_distributed_headers()`, `LLMObs.annotate()` to default to the current active LLM Observability-specific span if `span` is not provided.\r\n  - Introduces automatic distributed tracing support for LLM Observability traces involving the `concurrent.futures.thread` module.\r\n  - Introduces `metadata` argument to `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for`, which enables users to attach arbitrary structured metadata to custom evaluations.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `api gateway`: Adds preview support to create inferred AWS API Gateway spans when certain AWS Gateway headers are passed into the request. Requires `DD_TRACE_INFERRED_PROXY_SERVICES_ENABLED=true` to enable. For enablement instructions, [contact support.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/)\r\n  - `graphql`: Add span events on GraphQL error spans, allowing multiple errors to be surfaced on the span.\r\n  - `graphql`: Adds user-provided extensions to graphql error span events through the `DD_TRACE_GRAPHQL_ERROR_EXTENSIONS` environment variable. This is disabled by default; when set it allows users to capture their extensions.\r\n  - Introduces a `record_exception` method that adds an exception to a Span as a span event.

This fix improves detection accuracy by identifying the vulnerability at the `set_cookies` function and adding more context. **Warning:** This change updates the vulnerability hash, meaning that if it was previously silenced in the web dashboard, it may reappear as a new vulnerability.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n   - `botocore`: Moves bedrock token usage metrics on APM spans from the meta field under `bedrock.usage.{prompt/completion}_tokens` to the metrics field under `bedrock.response.usage.{prompt/completion}_tokens`.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where the Gemini and Vertex AI integrations were not properly submitting spans for streamed responses in the case that the generator is not fully consumed.\r\n  - Resolves an issue with correlating traces between APM and LLM Observability where trace IDs were always being converted to hexadecimal values which broke APM links for 64-bit trace IDs.\r\n  - Fixes non-LLM message inputs and outputs to be rendered as json rather than Python strings.\r\n\r\n- Profiling\r\n  - Fixes a crash in memory allocation profiler when tracking a large number of live allocations, caused by unsigned integer wraparound which lead to invalid memory access\r\n  - Fixes an issue where the profiler unnecessarily outputs log messages when it was unable to record a lock acquire event.\r\n\r\n- Single-Step Instrumentation\r\n  - Removes `boto3` from the minimum versions list to avoid blocking SSI on `boto3` version.\r\n  - Resolves an issue in which incorrect runtime version constraints prevented injection into processes using Python 3.13.1+\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `asyncio`: Fixes an issue where the name of a coroutine was being overridden by a ddtrace function.\r\n  - baggage: Fixes an issue where `ot-baggage` headers in wsgi apps were not properly recognized due to the `http_` header prefix. This ensures consistent baggage propagation in wsgi compatible web frameworks.\r\n  - configurations: This fix resolves an issue where `DD_TRACE_CLOUD_PAYLOAD_TAGGING_SERVICES` env variable was not parsed correctly\r\n  - configurations: Resolves an issue where accessing `ddtrace.config.<undefined_attribute>` would create an IntegrationConfig object instead of raising an AttributeError.\r\n  - internal: Require `bytecode>=0.15.1` for Python 3.12 to avoid [known bug](https://github.com/MatthieuDartiailh/bytecode/issues/130).\r\n  - internal: Fix `ddtrace` internal logger initialization mutating an unlocked shared resource.\r\n  - library: Updates the exception raised when `ddtrace.patch(...)` is called with an invalid argument.\r\n  - `pymongo`: Changes the mongodb.query span tag to json so it can be parsed by the agent.\r\n  - runtime_metrics: Ensures only the global service name is tagged on runtime metrics, instead of every service name found in the process.\r\n  - span: Fixes issue where spans weren't being handled correctly and were not being sent when using a custom Exception class that raises an exception in `__str__`.\r\n  - Captures the execution of async functions traced via DD_TRACE_METHODS, not just coroutine creation.

Also modifies `LLMObs.export_span()`, `LLMObs.inject_distributed_headers()`, `LLMObs.annotate()` to default to the current active LLM Observability-specific span if `span` is not provided.\r\n  - Introduces automatic distributed tracing support for LLM Observability traces involving the `concurrent.futures.thread` module.\r\n  - Introduces `metadata` argument to `LLMObs.submit_evaluation_for`, which enables users to attach arbitrary structured metadata to custom evaluations.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `api gateway`: Adds preview support to create inferred AWS API Gateway spans when certain AWS Gateway headers are passed into the request. Requires `DD_TRACE_INFERRED_PROXY_SERVICES_ENABLED=true` to enable. For enablement instructions, [contact support.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/help/)\r\n  - `graphql`: Add span events on GraphQL error spans, allowing multiple errors to be surfaced on the span.\r\n  - `graphql`: Adds user-provided extensions to graphql error span events through the `DD_TRACE_GRAPHQL_ERROR_EXTENSIONS` environment variable. This is disabled by default; when set it allows users to capture their extensions.\r\n  - Introduces a `record_exception` method that adds an exception to a Span as a span event.

    "body": "# **Migration Guide: Upgrading from dd-trace-py v2 to v3**\r\n\r\nWe are happy to announce the release of v3.0.0 of ddtrace. This release drops support for Python 3.7 and many previously-deprecated parts of the library interface.\r\n\r\nThe 2.x release line enters Maintenance Mode with the release of 3.0.0, meaning that it will only receive bugfix changes on its last few minor releases, and 2.21 will be the last 2.x minor version. See the [versioning policy](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/compatibility/python/#releases) for support level definitions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## **Summary of Significant Changes**\r\n\r\n* Removed support for Python 3.7 from the library\r\n\r\n### **CI Visibility**\r\n\r\n* The new pytest plugin is now the default.  \r\n* Module, suite, and test names are now parsed from `item.nodeid`.  \r\n* Test names now include the class name (`TestClass::test_method`) for class-based tests.  \r\n* Test skipping is now done at the suite level.  \r\n* The `DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN_BETA` environment variable is no longer used.\r\n\r\n### **LLM Observability**\r\n\r\n* Removed support for `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME`.  \r\n* The `parameters` argument in `LLMObs.annotate()` has been removed. Use `metadata` instead.  \r\n* Dropped support for OpenAI 0.x and Langchain v0.0.x.\r\n\r\n### **Tracing**\r\n\r\n* Removed all deprecated interfaces from integrations.  \r\n* `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=b3 single header` is no longer supported. Use `b3` instead.  \r\n* Dropped support for multiple Tracer instances. The global tracer instance `ddtrace.tracer` must be used.  \r\n* Removed deprecated parameters from `Tracer.configure(...)`.  \r\n* Dropped support for several deprecated tracing configurations. See \u201cEnvironment Variables\u201d section below for details.\r\n\r\n## **Recommended Pre-Upgrade Steps**\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading to v3, check for deprecation warnings in your application using the latest v2 release (**2.21.0**):\r\n\r\n### **Detect Deprecation Warnings in Tests**\r\n\r\nEnable warnings as errors in `pytest`:\r\n\r\n```\r\npytest -W \"error::ddtrace.DDTraceDeprecationWarning\" tests.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Detect Deprecation Warnings in Applications**\r\n\r\nSet the following environment variable to raise exceptions for deprecated usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDD_TRACE_RAISE_DEPRECATIONWARNING=1 ddtrace-run python app.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, enable all deprecation warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPYTHONWARNINGS=all python app.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Environment Variables**\r\n\r\nThe following environment variables have been removed or replaced in v3. Use the table below to update your configuration:\r\n\r\n| v2 | Removed in v3  | Replaced/Changed in v3 |\r\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\r\n| **LLM Observability** |  |  |\r\n| `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME` |  | Use `DD_LLMOBS_ML_APP` instead |\r\n| `_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES` |  | Use `DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES ` instead |\r\n| `_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS ` |  | Use `DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS ` instead |\r\n| **Tracing** |  |  |\r\n| `DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` | No replacement, this setting is now a no-op. Datadog Analytics is no longer supported. See the [ingestion controls documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=python) for more detail.|  |\r\n| `DD_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING` |  | Use `DD_TRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING`. |\r\n| `DD_TRACE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` | No replacement, this setting is now a no-op. Datadog Analytics is no longer supported. See the [ingestion controls documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=python) for more detail. |  |\r\n| `DD_TRACE_METHODS` (using `[]` notation) |  | Must use `:` notation instead, For example: `mod.submod:method1,method2;mod.submod:Class.method1`. ([docs](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html?highlight=dd_trace_methods#DD_TRACE_METHODS)) |\r\n| `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=\u201db3 single header\u201d` |  | Use `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=b3` for identical behavior |\r\n| `DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE` |  | Use `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES` ([docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_pipeline/ingestion_mechanisms/?tab=python#in-tracing-libraries-user-defined-rules)). |\r\n| `DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK` | No replacement (feature removed). Config variable is now a no-op. |  |\r\n| **CI Visibility** |  |  |\r\n| `DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN_BETA` | No replacement (new pytest plugin is not in beta anymore). |  |\r\n\r\nUse the following patterns to identify the deprecated environment variables in a code base:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit grep -P -e \"DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME\" \\\r\n  -e \"_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES\" \\\r\n  -e \"_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE=.*b3 single header\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_TRACE_API_VERSION=v0.3\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_TRACE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK\" \\\r\n  -e \"DD_TRACE_METHODS=.*\\[\\]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace deprecated settings with the recommended alternatives where applicable.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: The changes to environment variables apply only to the configuration of the dd-trace-py library and not the Datadog Agent.\r\n\r\n### **Legacy Interfaces**\r\n\r\nThe following methods and module attributes have been removed or changed. Unless noted, removal means that the functionality pointed to by the removed interface has been disabled.\r\n\r\n| v2 | v3 |\r\n| :---- | :---- |\r\n| **Tracing** |  |\r\n| `Tracer.configure( enabled=foo, hostname=foo, port=foo, uds_path=foo, https=foo, sampler=foo, wrap_executor=foo, priority_sampling=foo, settings=foo, dogstatsd_url=foo, writer=foo, partial_flush_enabled=foo, partial_flush_min_spans=foo, api_version=foo )` | `Tracer.configure()` |\r\n| `ddtrace.opentracer.tracer.Tracer()._dd_tracer` | `ddtrace.tracer` |\r\n| `ddtrace.tracer.sampler.rules[].choose_matcher(lambda: True)` | `ddtrace.tracer.sampler.rules[].choose_matcher(\u201cfoo\u201d)` Callables and regex patterns are no longer allowed as arguments to `choose_matcher` |\r\n| `Span.sampled` | `Span.context.sampling_priority > 0` |\r\n| **LLM Observability** |  |\r\n| `LLMObs.annotate(parameters=foo)` | `LLMObs.annotate(metadata=foo)` |\r\n\r\n### **Python 3.13 Support**\r\n\r\nMuch of the library\u2019s functionality has been compatible with Python 3.13 since version 2.20. Some pieces of functionality do not yet work with Python 3.13. Here\u2019s what does not work under Python 3.13 as of dd-trace-py 3.0. 'Not tested' indicates that while the feature may be compatible with Python 3.13, its functionality has not been verified, as it is not included in our automated test coverage.\r\n\r\n* `dd-trace-py` doesn\u2019t work on Windows with Python 3.13  \r\n* Appsec Threat Detection is not tested against Django, Flask, or FastAPI with 3.13  \r\n* Automatic Service Naming is not tested with 3.13  \r\n* The following products are not tested with 3.13:  \r\n  * Code Coverage  \r\n  * Appsec IAST  \r\n  * Data Streams Monitoring  \r\n  * CI Visibility  \r\n  * Continuous Profiling  \r\n* The following integrations are not tested with 3.13:  \r\n  * `anthropic`\r\n  * `consul`\r\n  * `freezegun`\r\n  * `gevent`\r\n  * `google_generativeai`\r\n  * `gunicorn`\r\n  * `langchain`  \r\n  * `mysqlclient`  \r\n  * `opentracing`  \r\n  * `psycopg`  \r\n  * `psycopg2`  \r\n  * `pymysql`  \r\n  * `pytest` \r\n  * `pytest-bdd`  \r\n  * `pytest-benchmark`  \r\n  * `sanic`  \r\n  * `selenium`  \r\n  * `sqlite3`  \r\n  * `starlette`  \r\n  * `tornado`  \r\n  * `vertexai`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, you can transition to dd-trace-py v3 gradually, ensuring minimal disruption to your services while taking advantage of the latest features and improvements. Happy migrating!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- Removes code and tests related to Python 3.7, breaking the library's compatibility with this Python version.\r\n\r\n- ASM\r\n  - Introduces use of meta struct for appsec event reports. This will improve performances. ASM will now require at least agent version 7.35.0 to work as expected.\r\n\r\n- Code Security (IAST)\r\n  - Introduces Code Security support to PyMySQL and MySQLDB integrations.\r\n  - XSS detection for Django applications and Jinja2 (Flask and FastAPI applications), which will be displayed on your DataDog Vulnerability Explorer dashboard.

The `ddtrace.provider` module is deprecated and will be removed in v3.0.0.\r\n  - Deprecates the following constants in `ddtrace.constants` module:\r\n    - `ANALYTICS_SAMPLE_RATE_KEY`\r\n    - `SAMPLE_RATE_METRIC_KEY`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_PRIORITY_KEY`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_AGENT_DECISION`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_RULE_DECISION`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_LIMIT_DECISION`\r\n    - `ORIGIN_KEY`\r\n    - `USER_ID_KEY`\r\n    - `HOSTNAME_KEY`\r\n    - `RUNTIME_FAMILY`\r\n    - `BASE_SERVICE_KEY`\r\n    - `SPAN_MEASURED_KEY`\r\n    - `KEEP_SPANS_RATE_KEY`\r\n    - `MULTIPLE_IP_HEADERS`\r\n    - `CONFIG_ENDPOINT_ENV`\r\n    - `CONFIG_ENDPOINT_RETRIES_ENV`\r\n    - `CONFIG_ENDPOINT_TIMEOUT_ENV`\r\n  - Internalizes the `ddtrace.settings.config` module and deprecates the following `ddtrace.config` attributes:\r\n    - `http`, use `DD_TRACE_HEADER_TAGS` environment variable instead.\r\n    - `http_server`, use `DD_TRACE_HTTP_SERVER_ERROR_STATUSES` environment variable instead.\r\n    - `trace_headers`, this attribute is internal to the tracer.\r\n    - `header_is_traced`, this attribute is internal to the tracer.\r\n    - `convert_rc_trace_sampling_rules`, this attribute is internal to the tracer.\r\n    - `enable_remote_configuration`, use `DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED` environment variable instead.\r\n    - `get_from`, use `ddtrace.trace.Pin` to set instance level configurations.\r\n  - configurations: Removes deprecated attributes from `ddtrace.config`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- ASM\r\n  - Ensures that no module from ASM are loaded when ASM is disabled or unavailable.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where IAST modules could be loaded, even if disabled, which could create an ImportError exception on Windows.\r\n\r\n- CI Visibility\r\n  - Fixes an issue where Auto Test Retries with pytest would always consider retries of tests defined inside unittest classes to be successful.\r\n\r\n- Code security (IAST)\r\n  - SCA: Ensures that no module from IAST are loaded when IAST is disabled or unavailable.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where the usage of `callonce` decorator could trigger an import loop\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - `openai`: Fixes a patching issue where asynchronous moderation endpoint calls resulted in coroutine scheduling errors.\r\n  - `vertexai`: Resolves an issue with `chat.send_message()` where the content keyword argument was not parsed correctly.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where successive calls to `LLMObs.annotate()` on the same span caused overwriting of metrics, metadata, and prompt dictionaries. Now, calling `LLMObs.annotate()` will merge new metrics/metadata/prompt values with any existing ones.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where spans were being enqueued to an inactive evaluator runner which caused noisy logs related to the evaluator runner buffer being full.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where explicitly only using `LLMObs.enable()` to configure LLM Observability without environment variables would not automatically propagate distributed tracing headers.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where annotating a span with non latin-1 (but valid utf-8) input/output values resulted in encoding errors.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where extracting token metadata from openai streamed chat completion token chunks caused an IndexError.\r\n\r\n- Profiling\r\n  - Fixes an issue on arm64 macOS where the profiler was not able to find native extension modules to enable the following features: `DD_PROFILING_TIMELINE_ENABLED` and `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED`.\r\n  - Fixes SystemError from the memory profiler returning NULL when collecting events\r\n\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `aiohttp`: Adds the environment variable `DD_AIOHTTP_CLIENT_DISABLE_STREAM_TIMING_FOR_MEM_LEAK` to address a potential memory leak in the aiohttp integration. When set to true, this flag may cause streamed response span timing to be inaccurate. The flag defaults to false.\r\n  - internal: Fix performance overhead of Python distribution parsing for internal telemetry.\r\n  - logging: Resolves an an unneeded info log being logged on process exit due to a forksafe hook being unregistered that was never registered to begin with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `cassandra`, `cherrypy`, `flask_cache`, `starlette`: Ensures a deprecation warning is not raised when patching these integrations via `ddtrace-run` and `import ddtrace.auto`.\r\n  - Ensures the ddtrace library does not use deprecated APIs internally. Deprecation warnings should only be logged when the user's code is using deprecated APIs.\r\n  - Removes the deprecated tracing modules and constants from the `ddtrace` package."

For continued cost estimation of OpenAI calls, enable [LLM Observability](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/).\r\n  - `langchain`: Removes prompt-completion log sampling from the LangChain integration. To continue logging prompt completions, enable LLM Observability.\r\n  - `langchain`: Removes integration metrics from the LangChain integration. To continue tracking operational metrics from the OpenAI integration, enable LLM Observability or use trace metrics instead.\r\n  - `openai`: Removes prompt-completion log sampling from the OpenAI integration. To continue logging prompt completions, enable LLM Observability.\r\n  - `openai`: Removes integration metrics from the OpenAI integration. To continue tracking operational metrics from the OpenAI integration, enable LLM Observability or use trace metrics instead.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - Drops support for multiple Tracer instances in the same process. Use `ddtrace.trace.tracer` to access the global tracer instance.\r\n  - Drops support for multiple tracer instances, `ddtrace.trace.Tracer` can not be reinitialized.\r\n  - Removes deprecated parameters from `Tracer.configure(...)` method and removes the `Tracer.sampler` attribute.\r\n  - configurations: Drops support for deprecated tracing configurations. The following configurations are no longer supported:\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE`, use `DD_TRACE_SAMPLING_RULES` instead.\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_API_VERSION`=v0.3, the default `v0.5` version is used instead.\r\n    - `DD_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`, Datadog Analytics is no longer supported.\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED`, Datadog Analytics is no longer supported.\r\n    - `DD_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING`, `DD_TRACE_HTTP_CLIENT_TAG_QUERY_STRING` should be used instead.\r\n    - `DD_TRACE_SPAN_AGGREGATOR_RLOCK`, disabling the span aggregator rlock is no longer supported.\r\n  - configurations: Drops support for configuring `DD_TRACE_METHODS` with the `[]` notation. Ensure `DD_TRACE_METHODS` use the `:` notation instead.\r\n  - opentracing: Removes the deprecated `ddtracer` parameter from `ddtrace.opentracer.tracer.Tracer()`.\r\n  - sampling: Drops support for configuring sampling rules using functions and regex in the `ddtrace.tracer.sampler.rules[].choose_matcher(...)` method and removes the `timestamp_ns` parameter from `ddtrace.internal.rate_limiter.RateLimiter.is_allowed()`.\r\n  - span: Removes the deprecated `Span.sampled` property.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `valkey`: Adds automatic instrumentation of the Valkey package. Thank you [AhmadMasry](https://github.com/AhmadMasry)!\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - `aiohttp`: Adds the environment variable `DD_AIOHTTP_CLIENT_DISABLE_STREAM_TIMING_FOR_MEM_LEAK` to address a potential memory leak in the `aiohttp` integration. When set to true, this flag may cause streamed response span timing to be inaccurate. The flag defaults to false.\r\n  - logging: Resolves an an unneeded info log being logged on process exit due to a forksafe hook being unregistered that was never registered to begin with.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "### Upgrade Notes\r\n- CI Visibility\r\n  - Official release of the new version of the pytest plugin, introducing the following features:  \r\n    - [Auto Test Retries](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/flaky_test_management/auto_test_retries)\r\n    - [Early Flake Detection](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/flaky_test_management/early_flake_detection)\r\n    - Improved coverage collection for [Test Impact Analysis](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tests/test_impact_analysis) (formerly Intelligent Test Runner), using an internal collection method instead of [coverage.py](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy), with improved dependency discovery.\r\n\r\n    **NOTE:** this new version of the plugin introduces breaking changes:  \r\n    - `module`, `suite`, and `test` names are now parsed from the `item.nodeid` attribute\r\n    - test names now include the class for class-based tests\r\n    - Test skipping by Test Impact Analysis (formerly Intelligent Test Runner) is now done at the suite level, instead of at the test level\r\n\r\n    A beta version of the plugin had been available since v2.18.0, and could be enabled via the `DD_PYTEST_USE_NEW_PLUGIN_BETA` environment variable. The new version is now the default, and the environment variable is not used anymore.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Support for the deprecated environment variable `DD_LLMOBS_APP_NAME` has been removed.\r\n  - Removes the deprecated `parameters` argument from `LLMObs annotate()`. Use `metadata` instead.\r\n  - `openai`: Drops tracing and LLM Observability support for OpenAI 0.x versions. To maintain support, upgrade to `openai>=1.0`.\r\n  - langchain: removed tracing support for `langchain.chains.base.Chains`. To maintain support, migrate to using Langchain's LCEL instead.\r\n  - langchain: Drops tracing and LLM Observability support for Langchain v0.0.x versions.\r\n\r\n- Profiling\r\n  - Bumps libdatadog dependency to v15.0.0.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - Removes deprecated interfaces from all integrations.\r\n  - propagation: Setting `DD_TRACE_PROPAGATION_STYLE` to `b3 single header` is no longer supported. Use `b3` instead.\r\n  - `aws_lambda`: Drops support for `aws_lambda<=6.105.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Deprecation Notes\r\n- ASM\r\n  - Deprecated env var `DD_APPSEC_AUTOMATED_USER_EVENTS_TRACKING` is now removed. Please use the new env var `DD_APPSEC_AUTO_USER_INSTRUMENTATION_MODE` instead.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - The `\\_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS` environment variable is deprecated and will be removed in ddtrace 3.0.0.  \r\n  As an alternative to `\\_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS`, you can use <span class=\"title-ref\">DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS</span> instead. To migrate, replace `\\_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS` with `DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATORS`.\r\n  - The `\\_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES` environment variable is deprecated and will be removed in ddtrace 3.0.0.  \r\n  As an alternative to `\\_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES`, you can use `DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES` instead. To migrate, replace `\\_DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES` with `DD_LLMOBS_EVALUATOR_SAMPLING_RULES`.\r\n\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - Moves `ddtrace.provider.BaseContextProvider` to `ddtrace.trace.BaseContextProvider`. The `ddtrace.provider` module is deprecated and will be removed in v3.0.0.\r\n  - Deprecates the following constants in `ddtrace.constants` module:\r\n    - `ANALYTICS_SAMPLE_RATE_KEY`\r\n    - `SAMPLE_RATE_METRIC_KEY`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_PRIORITY_KEY`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_AGENT_DECISION`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_RULE_DECISION`\r\n    - `SAMPLING_LIMIT_DECISION`\r\n    - `ORIGIN_KEY`\r\n    - `USER_ID_KEY`\r\n    - `HOSTNAME_KEY`\r\n    - `RUNTIME_FAMILY`\r\n    - `BASE_SERVICE_KEY`\r\n    - `SPAN_MEASURED_KEY`\r\n    - `KEEP_SPANS_RATE_KEY`\r\n    - `MULTIPLE_IP_HEADERS`\r\n    - `CONFIG_ENDPOINT_ENV`\r\n    - `CONFIG_ENDPOINT_RETRIES_ENV`\r\n    - `CONFIG_ENDPOINT_TIMEOUT_ENV`\r\n  - Internalizes the `ddtrace.settings.config` module and deprecates the following `ddtrace.config` attributes:\r\n    - `http`, use `DD_TRACE_HEADER_TAGS` environment variable instead.\r\n    - `http_server`, use `DD_TRACE_HTTP_SERVER_ERROR_STATUSES` environment variable instead.\r\n    - `trace_headers`, this attribute is internal to the tracer.\r\n    - `header_is_traced`, this attribute is internal to the tracer.\r\n    - `convert_rc_trace_sampling_rules`, this attribute is internal to the tracer.\r\n    - `enable_remote_configuration`, use `DD_REMOTE_CONFIGURATION_ENABLED` environment variable instead.\r\n    - `get_from`, use `ddtrace.trace.Pin` to set instance level configurations.\r\n  - Removes deprecated attributes from `ddtrace.config`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- Removes code and tests related to Python 3.7, breaking the library's compatibility with this Python version.\r\n\r\n- ASM\r\n  - Introduces use of meta struct for appsec event reports. This will improve performances. ASM will now require at least agent version 7.35.0 to work as expected.\r\n\r\n- Code Security (IAST)\r\n  - Introduces Code Security support to PyMySQL and MySQLDB integrations.\r\n  - XSS detection for Django applications, which will be displayed on your DataDog Vulnerability Explorer dashboard. See the [Application Vulnerability Management](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/application_security/vulnerability_management/) documentation for more information about this feature.\r\n  - Implements the detection of the Stacktrace-Leak vulnerability for Django, Flask and FastAPI.\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - openai: Introduces tracing support to the OpenAI integration for Python versions 3.12 and 3.13.\r\n  - Introduces an integration with the [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) evaluation framework to continuously monitor  \r\n  the performance of context-augmented LLM generations in production.\r\n  The integration supports evaluating LLM inferences with the following RAGAS metrics:\r\n    - [Faithfulness](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/faithfulness/): measures if the LLM response is faithful to the provided context.\r\n    - [Answer Relevancy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/answer_relevance/): measures how relevant the LLM response is to the user input.\r\n    - [Context Precision](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/context_precision/): measures how effectively the context is used in the generated response.\r\n  To learn more, see the [LLM Observability evaluations guide](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/submit_evaluations/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- ASM\r\n  - Resolves an issue where IAST modules could be loaded, even if disabled, which could create an ImportError exception on Windows.\r\n\r\n- CI Visibility\r\n  - Fixes an issue where Auto Test Retries with pytest would always consider retries of tests defined inside unittest classes to be successful.\r\n\r\n- Code security (IAST)\r\n  - Resolves an issue where the usage of <span class=\"title-ref\">callonce</span> decorator could trigger an import loop\r\n\r\n- LLM Observability\r\n  - Resolves an issue where successive calls to `LLMObs.annotate()` on the same span caused overwriting of metrics, metadata, and prompt dictionaries. Now, calling `LLMObs.annotate()` will merge new metrics/metadata/prompt values with any existing ones.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where spans were being enqueued to an inactive evaluator runner which caused noisy logs related to the evaluator runner buffer being full.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where explicitly only using `LLMObs.enable()` to configure LLM Observability without environment variables would not automatically propagate distributed tracing headers.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where annotating a span with non latin-1 (but valid utf-8) input/output values resulted in encoding errors.\r\n  - Resolves an issue where extracting token metadata from openai streamed chat completion token chunks caused an IndexError.\r\n  - `openai`: Fixes a patching issue where asynchronous moderation endpoint calls resulted in coroutine scheduling errors.\r\n  - `vertexai`: Resolves an issue with `chat.send_message()` where the content keyword argument was not parsed correctly.\r\n\r\n- Profiling\r\n  - Fixes an issue on arm64 macOS where the profiler was not able to find native extension modules to enable the following features: `DD_PROFILING_TIMELINE_ENABLED` and `DD_PROFILING_STACK_V2_ENABLED`.\r\n  - Fixes SystemError from the memory profiler returning NULL when collecting events\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n- Tracing\r\n  - Ensures the ddtrace library does not use deprecated APIs internally. Deprecation warnings should only be logged when the user's code is using deprecated APIs.\r\n  - `cassandra` , `cherrypy`, `flask_cache`, `starlette`: Ensures a deprecation warning is not raised when patching these integrations via `ddtrace-run` and `import ddtrace.auto`.\r\n  - Removes the deprecated tracing modules and constants from the `ddtrace` package."
