    "body": "Today, we are excited to share the\u00a0`6.5.0`\u00a0stable release\u00a0\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f **Help us spread the word about Prisma by starring the repo \u261d\ufe0f or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20the%20latest%20@prisma%20release%20v6.5.0%20%F0%9F%9A%80%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.5.0) about the release.** \ud83c\udf1f\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### Databases can only be reset manually and explicitly\r\n\r\nIn previous versions, if Prisma ORM determined that a `migrate` command could not be applied cleanly to the underlying database, you would get a message like this one:\r\n\r\n```\r\n? We need to reset the \"public\" schema at \"db.url.com:5432\"\r\nDo you want to continue? All data will be lost. (y/N)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile \"no\" was the default, we've determined that having this prompt in the first place was a mistake. In this version we're removing the prompt entirely and instead exiting with an appropriate error message.\r\n\r\nTo get the previous behavior, you will need to run `prisma migrate reset` directly.\r\n\r\n### Support for `prisma.config.ts` in Prisma Studio\r\n\r\nWe've expanded support for our `prisma.config.ts` file to include Prisma Studio!\r\n\r\nTo use the new config file, including the ability to connect to driver adapter enabled databases with Prisma Studio, add a `studio` block to your `prisma.config.ts` file:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport path from 'node:path'\r\nimport type { PrismaConfig } from 'prisma'\r\nimport { PrismaLibSQL } from '@prisma/adapter-libsql'\r\nimport { createClient } from '@libsql/client'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  earlyAccess: true,\r\n  schema: {\r\n    kind: 'single',\r\n    filePath: './prisma/schema.prisma',\r\n  },\r\n  studio: {\r\n    adapter: async (env: unknown) => {\r\n      const connectionString = `file:./dev.db'\r\n      const libsql = createClient({\r\n        url: connectionString,\r\n      })\r\n      return new PrismaLibSQL(libsql)\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n} satisfies PrismaConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how this looks a little different from last release! Instead of an `@prisma/config` package there\u2019s now two different options:\r\n\r\n1. Using the `defineConfig` helper exported by `prisma/config`. \r\n2. Using the `PrismaConfig` utility type exported by `Prisma`. \r\n\r\nAll the relevant info for the `prisma.config.ts` file, including these new ways of defining your config, [can be found in our docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference).\r\n\r\n### Allow for chaining `$on` and `$extends`. \r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Prisma ORM, the return type of the `$on` client method was `void`. This did not allow for chaining `$on()` and `$extends()` calls, as `$on` is not available on extended clients. \r\n\r\nIn this version we've resolved this issue and `$on` will now return the modified Prisma Client.\r\n\r\n### Community fixes\r\n\r\nWe have a number of community-submitted fixes that improve Prisma ORM:\r\n- [Allow for binaries to be loaded from local network](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/23001). Thank you @RaHehl!\r\n- [Enhance type safety of the AtLeast utility type](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/24056). Thank you @de-novo!\r\n- [Resolve a race condition in the NextJS monorepo plugin](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/21370). Thank you @toniopelo!\r\n- [allow for filtering out spans with PrismaInstrumentation](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/20113). Thank you @overbit!\r\n\r\n## Prisma is hiring\r\n\r\nJoin us at Prisma and work on [our TypeScript ORM (now faster than ever)](https://www.prisma.io/blog/rust-to-typescript-update-boosting-prisma-orm-performance) and our Cloud products [like Prisma Postgres (now in GA!)](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-postgres-the-future-of-serverless-databases)\r\n\r\nWe currently have two open roles in our Engineering team:\r\n\r\n- [Developer Support Engineer (Americas)](https://ats.rippling.com/prisma-careers/jobs/99a4a4e0-02ff-4e0a-867e-3730bcd9b6c3)\r\n- [Senior Engineering Manager](https://ats.rippling.com/prisma-careers/jobs/0f9295a1-6111-4814-bf9b-a5eb2002bf34)\r\n\r\nIf these don\u2019t fit, you can still check out our [jobs page](https://www.prisma.io/careers) and send a general application.\r\n\r\n## Enterprise support\r\n\r\nPrisma offers an [enterprise support plan](https://www.prisma.io/enterprise#contact-us) for Prisma ORM. Get direct help from our team and a joint slack channel! [With Prisma ORM 7 on the horizon](https://www.prisma.io/blog/rust-to-typescript-update-boosting-prisma-orm-performance) this is a great time to upgrade your support today.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThank you to @overbit, @RaHehl, @toniopelo, and @de-novo for your contributions to this release!",

It needs to live in the current working directory from where you're executing Prisma CLI commands (typically, the root of your project).\r\n\r\n> **Note**: If you're using `prisma.config.ts`, the Prisma CLI will not load environment variables from `.env` files. If you want to use a `.env` file with `prisma.config.ts`, you'll need to load the environment variables manually using the [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) package (see [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference)).\r\n\r\nLearn more about the new `prisma.config.ts` file in the [docs](https://prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference).\r\n\r\n### Case-insensitive mode in JSON filters\r\n\r\nYou can now do case-insensitive filtering on JSON data. \r\n\r\nJust use the new `mode` option when filtering using `string_contains`, `string_starts_with` or `string_ends_with` in a JSON object and set it to `\"insensitive\"`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nawait prisma.user.findMany({\r\n  where: {\r\n    pets: {\r\n      path: ['favorites', 'catBreed'],\r\n      string_contains: 'Van',\r\n      mode: \"insensitive\",\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above query returns all users where the `favorites.catBreed` value contains `\"Van\"` or `\"van\"`.\r\n\r\nThanks to [@lubosmato](https://github.com/lubosmato) who [implemented](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/4977) this feature \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n### Improved CockroachDB migration speed\r\n\r\nIn this release we found some inefficiencies in our migration engine that was impacting CockroachDB migrations. In 6.4.0, CockroachDB migrations should be significantly faster.\r\n\r\n## Calling all devs: Give us your feedback!\r\n\r\nPrisma ORM's community keeps us going. To make sure that we're focused on what the community needs, we would like to get your feedback via our online [feedback form](https://pris.ly/orm/survey/release-6-4).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @lubosmato, @notomo,  @Mayureshd-18, @mydea, @omar-dulaimi and @Hazmi35 for helping out with this release!\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Today, we are excited to share the\u00a0`6.3.0`\u00a0stable release\u00a0\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f **Help us spread the word about Prisma by starring the repo \u261d\ufe0f or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20the%20latest%20@prisma%20release%20v6.3.0%20%F0%9F%9A%80%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.3.0) about the release.** \ud83c\udf1f\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### A brand new Prisma Studio\r\n\r\nIn this release we've included several *great* improvements to Prisma Studio's developer experience. You can learn all about the changes we've made in our [release blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/we-made-prisma-studio-even-better), but here's a short list:\r\n\r\n#### Prisma Studio is back in the Console\r\n\r\nFans of Prisma Data Browser rejoice! The new Prisma Studio is now in [the Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) and is available for all PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.\r\n\r\n#### A new model viewer\r\n\r\nPreviously, switching from model to model in Prisma Studio would require backing all the way out to the model view, then digging in again. With our new UI, it's easy to switch from model to model while keeping your place.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb3f4ed-7b7a-4f76-afd4-5b4a3081caff)\r\n\r\n#### A new editing experience\r\n\r\nIf you're trying to edit a given field in a model, Prisma Studio made it quite easy. However, if you're trying to edit every field in a given row, it could get quite annoying to keep scrolling left to right. Our new edit sidebar resolves that with the ability to edit all fields for a given row at once.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00ca97d3-2fc6-4302-82c4-6290549be14a)\r\n\r\n#### Clean up at the click of a button\r\n\r\nWhen editing a number of models, it can get difficult to get back to a clean slate. In the new Prisma Studio, we've added a \"Close all\" button that puts you back to a fresh start.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/847b0c5f-f67d-4cf1-986f-a178b965610b)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Add `limit` to `updateMany()` and `deleteMany()`\r\n\r\nPreviously, `limit` has not existed as a valid option in top level `updateMany()` and `deleteMany()` queries. In 6.3.0 `limit` is now available in these queries, bringing their features more in line with other query types. \r\n\r\nYou can use `limit` like the following:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nawait prisma.user.deleteMany({\r\n  where: { column: 'value' },\r\n  limit: 100,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will limit the number of deleted users to 100 at maximum. \r\n\r\n### Sort `generator` fields deterministically\r\n\r\nIn previous version of Prisma ORM, the fields inside of a `generator` block in your Prisma Schema were not deterministically sorted. This could lead to cases where `prisma db pull` could lead to re-ordering of fields. \r\n\r\nIn 6.3.0, the sorting of fields in this block is now deterministic. You may see re-ordering on the first `prisma db pull` after you upgrade, but it will remain consistent afterwards.\r\n\r\n### Replace `NOT IN` with `NOT EXISTS` for PostgreSQL relation filters\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Prisma ORM, when using the `none` or `some` relation filters, the SQL queries generated used `NOT IN`. In many cases this lead to performance issues as the size of the related table grew. In 6.3.0, we\u2019ve replaced these usages of `IN` with `EXISTS` in order to improve query performance.\r\n\r\n## A special thank you\r\n\r\nWe'd like to extend our heartfelt thanks to @loren and his team for the collaboration and trust in our enterprise support plan. Working closely with them allowed us to address important issues like #19249 and #17303. Their insights and partnership have been invaluable in improving our product.\r\n\r\nIf your team could benefit from dedicated support and tailored solutions, [learn more](https://www.prisma.io/enterprise?utm_source=release-notes&utm_campaign=thanks#contact-us) about our enterprise support plan.\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma Client\r\n\r\n- [Add `take` or `limit` to `updateMany()` & `deleteMany()`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6957)\r\n\r\n### Prisma\r\n\r\n- [Prisma interactive transaction ignores DB exception on commit (with triggers)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17303)\r\n- [`prisma db pull` non-deterministically sorts generator fields](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17899)\r\n- [`no entry found for key` error on views<->model relations](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19249)\r\n- [Adding `onUpdate` data to the DMMF in `@prisma/generator-helper`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/25944)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @WhyAsh5114 for their contributions to this release!",

    "body": "Today we're releasing Prisma ORM version 6.2.0 \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f **Help us spread the word about Prisma by starring the repo or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20the%20latest%20@prisma%20release%20v6.2.0%20%F0%9F%9A%80%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.2.0) about the release.** \ud83c\udf1f\r\n\r\nWe have a number of new features in this version, including support for `json` and `enum` fields in SQLite, a new `updateManyAndReturn` function, support for ULID values, as well as the promotion of the `omit` feature from Preview to Generally Availability.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### Excluding fields via `omit` is now production-ready\r\n\r\nOur [number one](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5042) requested feature is out of Preview and Generally Available. In 6.2.0, you no longer need to add `omitApi` to your list of Preview features:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n- previewFeatures = [\"omitApi\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a refresher: `omit` allows you to exclude certain fields from being returned in the results of your Prisma Client queries.\r\n\r\nYou can either do this locally, on a _per-query_ level:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst result = await prisma.user.findMany({\r\n  omit: {\r\n    password: true,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr globally, to ensure a field is excluded from _all_ queries of a certain model:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient({\r\n  omit: {\r\n    user: {\r\n      password: true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\n// The password field is excluded in all queries, including this one\r\nconst user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: 1 } })\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information on `omit`, be sure to [check our documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/excluding-fields).\r\n\r\n### `json` and `enum` fields in SQLite\r\n\r\nPrevious to this version, you could not define [`json`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3786) and [`enum`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2219) fields in your Prisma schema when using SQLite. The respective GitHub issues have been among the most popular ones in our repo, so with our [new approach to open-source governance](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-orm-manifesto), we finally got to work and implemented these.\r\n\r\nWorking with JSON and Enum fields works similarly to other database providers, here\u2019s an example:\r\n\r\n```prisma\r\ndatasource db {\r\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\r\n  url      = \"file:./dev.db\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())\r\n  name String\r\n  role Role  \r\n  data Json\r\n}\r\n\r\nenum Role {\r\n  Customer\r\n  Admin \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support for auto-generated ULID values\r\n\r\nSimilar to `cuid2` support released in ORM version 6.0.0, we are now adding support for [Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers](https://github.com/ulid/spec) (or short: ULIDs \ud83d\ude04) in version 6.2.0. A ULID value is a  26-character alphanumeric string, e.g. `01GZ0GZ3XARH8ZP44A7TQ2W4ZD`.\r\n\r\nWith this new feature, you can now create records with auto-generated ULID values for `String` fields:\r\n\r\n```prisma\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id String @id @default(ulid())  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New batch function: `updateManyAndReturn`\r\n\r\n`updateMany` allows you to update many records in your database, but it only returns the count of the affected rows, not the resulting rows themselves. With `updateManyAndReturn` you are now able to achieve this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst users = await prisma.user.updateManyAndReturn({\r\n  where: {\r\n    email: {\r\n      contains: 'prisma.io',\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  data: {\r\n    role: 'ADMIN'\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis call to `updateManyAndReturn` will now return the actual records that have been updated in the query:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[{\r\n  id: 22,\r\n  name: 'Alice',\r\n  email: 'alice@prisma.io',\r\n  profileViews: 0,\r\n  role: 'ADMIN',\r\n  coinflips: []\r\n}, {\r\n  id: 23,\r\n  name: 'Bob',\r\n  email: 'bob@prisma.io',\r\n  profileViews: 0,\r\n  role: 'ADMIN',\r\n  coinflips: []\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that like `createManyAndReturn`, `updateManyAndReturn` is only supported in PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, and SQLite.\r\n\r\n### Fixed runtime error in Node.js v23\r\n\r\nWhile not [_officially_ supported](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/system-requirements#software-requirements), we understand that a lot of you like to be on the latest Node.js version \u2014 so we fixed an error that only occurred on Node.js 23. Happy coding \u270c\ufe0f\r\n\r\n## Prisma is hiring \ud83e\udd1d\r\n\r\nJoin us at Prisma to work on the [most popular TypeScript ORM](https://www.prisma.io/blog/how-prisma-orm-became-the-most-downloaded-orm-for-node-js) and other exciting products like [the first serverless database built on unikernels](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access?utm_source=website&utm_medium=postgres-page)! \r\n\r\nWe currently have two open roles in our Engineering team:\r\n\r\n- [Senior Software Engineer (Prisma ORM)](https://ats.rippling.com/en-GB/prisma-careers/jobs/2398ed90-0c4a-478f-b69f-ab213df03b61)\r\n- [Senior Software Engineer (Prisma Data Platform)](https://ats.rippling.com/en-GB/prisma-careers/jobs/6b65e19a-8166-483c-8d44-222d05e16295)\r\n\r\nIf these don\u2019t fit, you can still check out our [jobs page](https://www.prisma.io/careers) and send a general application.",

    "body": "Today we're releasing Prisma ORM version 6.1.0\r\n\r\nIn this version our `tracing` Preview feature is being graduated to GA!\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### Tracing goes GA\r\n\r\nThe `tracing` Preview feature is now stable. You now no longer have to include `tracing` in your set of enabled preview features.\r\n\r\n```diff \r\ngenerator client {\r\n   provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n-  previewFeatures = [\"tracing\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have also changed some of the spans generated by Prisma Client. Previously, a trace would report the following spans:\r\n```\r\nprisma:client:operation\r\nprisma:client:serialize\r\nprisma:engine\r\nprisma:engine:connection\r\nprisma:engine:db_query\r\nprisma:engine:serialize\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the following are reported:\r\n```\r\nprisma:client:operation\r\nprisma:client:serialize\r\nprisma:engine:query\r\nprisma:engine:connection\r\nprisma:engine:db_query\r\nprisma:engine:serialize\r\nprisma:engine:response_json_serialization\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have made a few changes to our dependencies:\r\n- `@opentelemetry/api` is now a peer dependency instead of a regular dependency\r\n- `registerInstrumentations ` in `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` is now re-exported by `@prisma/instrumentation`\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to Prisma ORM 6.1.0 you will need to add `@opentelemetry/api` to your dependencies if you haven't already:\r\n```\r\nnpm install @opentelemetry/api\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will also no longer need to have `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` if you only use `registerInstrumentations`. In this case you can import `registerInstrumentations` from `@prisma/instrumentation`\r\n```diff\r\n- import { PrismaInstrumentation } from '@prisma/instrumentation'\r\n+ import { PrismaInstrumentation, registerInstrumentations } from '@prisma/instrumentation'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mutli-line comments in Prisma Schema Language (PSL)\r\n\r\nComments can now be defined as multi-line in your Prisma schema! Comments can use the existing format:\r\n\r\n```prisma\r\n// this is a schema comment\r\n```\r\n\r\nor can now also use our multi-line format:\r\n```prisma\r\n/*\r\n * this is a multi-line comment\r\n * You can add in all you want here\r\n * Keep typing and this comment will keep on going\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Tracing related\r\n\r\nAs we're moving our `tracing` preview to GA, a number of issues have been resolved.

Before upgrading, we recommend that you check out our [upgrade guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-6) to understand the impact on your application.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have an overview of what we accomplished since v5, check out our announcement blog post: [Prisma 6: Better Performance, More Flexibility & Type-Safe SQL](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-6-better-performance-more-flexibility-and-type-safe-sql).\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f\u00a0**Help us spread the word about Prisma by starring the repo\u00a0\u261d\ufe0f\u00a0or\u00a0[posting on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20the%20latest%20@prisma%20release%20v6.0.0%20%F0%9F%9A%80%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.0.0)\u00a0about the release.**\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u00a0This section contains a list of breaking changes. If you upgrade your application to Prisma ORM v6 without addressing these, your application is going to break! **For detailed upgrade instructions, check out the [upgrade guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-6).** \u26a0\ufe0f\u00a0\r\n\r\n### Minimum supported Node.js versions\r\n\r\nThe new minimum supported Node.js versions for Prisma ORM v6 are:\r\n\r\n- for Node.js 18 the minimum supported version is **18.18.0**\r\n- for Node.js 20 the minimum supported version is **20.9.0**\r\n- for Node.js 22 the minimum supported version is **22.11.0**\r\n\r\nThere is no official support for Node.js <18.18.0, 19, 21, 23.\r\n\r\n### Minimum supported TypeScript version\r\n\r\nThe new minimum supported TypeScript version for Prisma ORM v6 is: **5.1.0**.\r\n\r\n### Schema change for implicit m-n relations on PostgreSQL\r\n\r\nIf you're using PostgreSQL and are defining\u00a0[implicit many-to-many relations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#implicit-many-to-many-relations)\u00a0in your Prisma schema, Prisma ORM maintains the\u00a0[relation table](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/many-to-many-relations#relation-tables)\u00a0for you under the hood. This relation table has\u00a0`A`\u00a0and\u00a0`B`\u00a0columns to represent the tables of the models that are part of this relation.\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of Prisma ORM used to create a\u00a0_unique index_\u00a0on these two columns. In Prisma v6, this unique index is changing to a\u00a0_primary key_\u00a0in order to\u00a0[simplify for the default replica identity behaviour](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/25196).\r\n\r\nIf you're defining implicit m-n relations in your Prisma schema,\u00a0the next migration you'll create will contain\u00a0`ALTER TABLE`\u00a0statements for\u00a0_all_\u00a0the relation tables\u00a0that belong to these relations.\r\n\r\n### Full-text search on PostgreSQL\r\n\r\nThe `fullTextSearch` Preview feature is promoted to General Availability only for MySQL. This means that if you're using PostgreSQL and currently make use of this Preview feature, you now need to use the new `fullTextSearchPostgres` Preview feature.\r\n\r\n### Usage of\u00a0`Buffer`\r\n\r\nPrisma v6 replaces the usage of [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) with [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) to represent fields of type `Bytes`. Make sure to replace all your occurrences of the `Buffer` type with the new `Uint8Array`.\r\n\r\n### Removed\u00a0`NotFoundError`\r\n\r\nIn Prisma v6, we removed the\u00a0`NotFoundError`\u00a0in favor of\u00a0`PrismaClientKnownRequestError`\u00a0with error code\u00a0[`P2025`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/error-reference#p2025)\u00a0in\u00a0[`findUniqueOrThrow()`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#finduniqueorthrow)\u00a0and\u00a0[`findFirstOrThrow()`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#findfirstorthrow). If you've relied on catching\u00a0`NotFoundError`\u00a0instances in your code, you need to adjust the code accordingly.\r\n\r\n### New keywords that can't be used as model names: `async`, `await`, `using`\r\n\r\nWith this release, you can't use `async`, `await` and `using` as model names any more.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u00a0**For detailed upgrade instructions, check out the [upgrade guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-6).**  \u26a0\ufe0f\u00a0\r\n\r\n## Preview features promoted to General Availability\r\n\r\nIn this release, we are promoting a number of\u00a0[Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#preview)\u00a0features to\u00a0[General Availability](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#generally-available-ga).\r\n\r\n### `fullTextIndex`\r\n\r\nIf you use the\u00a0[full-text index](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/indexes#full-text-indexes-mysql-and-mongodb)\u00a0feature in your app, you can now remove\u00a0`fullTextIndex`\u00a0from the\u00a0`previewFeatures`\u00a0in your Prisma schema:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n- previewFeatures = [\"fullTextIndex\"]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `fullTextSearch`\r\n\r\nIf you use the\u00a0[full-text search](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/full-text-search)\u00a0feature with\u00a0**MySQL**\u00a0in your app, you can now remove\u00a0`fullTextSearch`\u00a0from the\u00a0`previewFeatures`\u00a0in your Prisma schema:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n- previewFeatures = [\"fullTextSearch\"]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using it with\u00a0**PostgreSQL**, you need to update the name of the feature flag to\u00a0`fullTextSearchPostgres`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ngenerator client {  \r\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n- previewFeatures = [\"fullTextSearch\"]  \r\n+ previewFeatures = [\"fullTextSearchPostgres\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\nWe are also releasing new features with this release:\r\n\r\n- [cuid2() support](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5047)\r\n- [Include unused enum definitions in `prisma generate`'s output](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/25740)\r\n- [Improved compatibility with Deno 2](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/25734)\r\n\r\n## Company news\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\ude80\u00a0Prisma Postgres is free during Early Access\r\n\r\nIn case you missed it: We recently launched [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-prisma-postgres-early-access), a serverless database with zero cold starts, a generous free tier, connection pooling, real-time events, and a lot more! It\u2019s entirely free during the Early Access phase, try it now!\r\n\r\n### \u2728\u00a0Let us know what you think of Prisma ORM\r\n\r\nWe're always trying to improve! If you've recently used Prisma ORM, we'd appreciate hearing your thoughts about your experience via this [2min survey](https://pris.ly/orm/survey/release-5-22).",

This should lead to better compatibility with tools such as DataDog and Sentry.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve also included numerous bug fixes that should make this Preview feature easier to work with.\r\n\r\n### Metrics bug fix\r\n\r\nOccasionally, connection pool metrics would become negative or grow unbounded. In this release, connection pool metrics should stay consistent.\r\n\r\n### Connection Pool Timeout fix\r\n\r\nIn a specific case, there could be issues where fetching a new connection from the connection pool would time out, regardless of the state of the application and connection pool. If you have experience connection pool issues accessing a  PostgreSQL database with TLS encryption in a resource-constrained environment (such as Function-as-a-Service offerings or very small VPS) this should resolve those issues.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @youxq for their pull request and help resolving this issue!\r\n\r\n## Join us\r\nLooking to make an impact on Prisma in a big way?

This is a part of the ongoing effort to stabilize this Preview feature and release it in General Availability.\r\n\r\n`tracing` is a Preview feature that enables built-in support for OpenTelemetry instrumentation inside the Prisma Client and provides deep insights into the performance and timing of your queries. See our [documentation for more information](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/opentelemetry-tracing).\r\n\r\nFor an easy to use and zero-configuration tracing instrumentation tool with a dashboard that provides an overview of your queries, statistics, and AI-powered recommendations, try [Prisma Optimize](https://pris.ly/gh/optimize).\r\n\r\n### WebAssembly engine size decrease for edge functions\r\n\r\nDue to recent changes, some users experienced a steep increase of the bundle size in Prisma 5.20 when using [the `driverAdapters` Preview feature](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters), going over the 1 MB limit on the free tier of Cloudflare Workers. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma Engines\r\n\r\n- [Avoid regex crate for wasm bundle size (to keep cloudflare free plan)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/5008)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @austin-tildei, @LucianBuzzo, @mcuelenaere, @pagewang0, @key-moon, @pranayat, @yubrot, @skyzh for helping!",

This change is direct feedback from [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20169) and follows [our latest proposal](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20169#issuecomment-2338360300) on the same issue. \r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the change, take the following code snippet:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nprisma.table.deleteMany({\r\n  where: {\r\n    // If `nullableThing` is nullish, this query will remove all data.\r\n    email: nullableThing?.property,\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Prisma ORM 5.19.0 and below, this could result in unintended behavior. In Prisma ORM 5.20.0, if the `strictUndefinedChecks` Preview feature is enabled, you will get a runtime error instead:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nInvalid \\`prisma.user.findMany()\\` invocation in\r\n/client/tests/functional/strictUndefinedChecks/test.ts:0:0\r\n  XX })\r\n  XX \r\n  XX test('throws on undefined input field', async () => {\r\n\u2192 XX   const result = prisma.user.deleteMany({\r\n         where: {\r\n           email: undefined\r\n                  ~~~~~~~~~\r\n         }\r\n       })\r\nInvalid value for argument \\`where\\`: explicitly \\`undefined\\` values are not allowed.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have also introduced the `Prisma.skip` symbol, which will allow you to get the previous behavior if desired.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nprisma.table.findMany({\r\n  where: {\r\n    // Use Prisma.skip to skip parts of the query\r\n    email: nullableEmail ?? Prisma.skip\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom Prisma ORM 5.20.0 onward, we recommend enabling `strictUndefinedChecks`, along with the TypeScript compiler option `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, which will help catch cases of undefined values at compile time. Together, these two changes will help protect your Prisma queries from potentially destructive behavior. \r\n\r\n`strictUndefinedChecks` will be a valid Preview feature for the remainder of Prisma ORM 5. With our next major version, this behavior will become the default and the Preview feature will be \u201cgraduated\u201d to Generally Available. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or feedback about `strictUndefinedChecks`, please ask/comment in our dedicated [Preview feature GitHub discussion](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/25271).\r\n\r\n### `typedSql` bug fix\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who has tried out our [`typedSql` Preview feature](https://www.prisma.io/blog/announcing-typedsql-make-your-raw-sql-queries-type-safe-with-prisma-orm) and [provided feedback](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/25106)! This release has a quick fix for typescript files generated when Prisma Schema enums had hyphens.\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma\r\n\r\n- [Prisma incorrectly parses CRDB's FK constraint error as `not available`.](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/24072)\r\n- [Invalid TypeScript files created by `generate` when typedSql is enabled and enum contains hyphens.](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/25163)\r\n- [`@prisma/internals` didn't list `ts-toolbelt` in dependencies.](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17952)\r\n- [using `$extends` prevents model comments from being passed to TypeScript](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/24648)\r\n\r\n### Prisma Engines\r\n\r\n- [Planetscale engine tests: interactive_tx](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4469)\r\n- [Fix broken engine size publishing workflow](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4991)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @mcuelenaere, @pagewang0, @key-moon, @pranayat, @yubrot, @thijmenjk, @mydea, @HRM, @haaawk, @baileywickham, @brian-dlee, @nickcarnival, @eruditmorina, @nzakas, and @gutyerrez for helping!",

    "body": "Today, we are excited to share the\u00a0`5.19.0`\u00a0stable release\u00a0\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f **Help us spread the word about Prisma by starring the repo or [posting on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20the%20latest%20@prisma%20release%20v5.19.0%20%F0%9F%9A%80%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.19.0) about the release.** \ud83c\udf1f\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### Introducing TypedSQL\r\n\r\nTypedSQL is a brand new way to interact with your database from Prisma Client. After enabling the `typedSql` Preview feature, you\u2019re able to write SQL queries in a new `sql` subdirectory of your `prisma` directory. These queries are then checked by Prisma during using the new `--sql` flag of `prisma generate` and added to your client for use in your code.\r\n\r\nTo get started with TypedSQL:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that you have the latest version of `prisma` and `@prisma/client` installed:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    npm install -D prisma@latest\r\n    npm install @prisma/client@latest\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n2. Enable the `typedSql` Preview feature in your Prisma Schema.\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n       generator client {\r\n         provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n         previewFeatures = [\"typedSql\"]\r\n       }\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n3. Create a `sql` subdirectory of your `prisma` directory.\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    mkdir -p prisma/sql\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n4. You can now add `.sql` files to the `sql` directory! Each file can contain one sql query and the name must be a valid JS identifier. For this example, say you had the file `getUsersWithPosts.sql` with the following contents:\r\n    \r\n    ```sql\r\n    SELECT u.id, u.name, COUNT(p.id) as \"postCount\"\r\n    FROM \"User\" u\r\n    LEFT JOIN \"Post\" p ON u.id = p.\"authorId\"\r\n    GROUP BY u.id, u.name\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n5. Import your SQL query into your code with the `@prisma/client/sql` import:\r\n    \r\n    ```tsx\r\n       import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'\r\n       import { getUsersWithPosts } from '@prisma/client/sql'\r\n    \r\n       const prisma = new PrismaClient()\r\n    \r\n       const usersWithPostCounts = await prisma.$queryRawTyped(getUsersWithPosts)\r\n       console.log(usersWithPostCounts)\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot more to talk about with TypedSQL. We think that the combination of the high-level Prisma Client API and the low-level TypedSQL will make for a great developer experience for all of our users.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about behind the \u201cwhy\u201d of TypedSQL [be sure to check out our announcement blog post](https://pris.ly/typedsql-blog).\r\n\r\nFor docs, check out our new [TypedSQL section](https://pris.ly/d/typedsql).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n### Driver adapters and D1\r\n\r\nA few issues with our `driverAdapters` Preview feature and Cloudflare D1 support were resolved via https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/4970 and https://github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/24922\r\n- Mathematic operations such as `max`, `min`, `eq`, etc in queries when using Cloudflare D1.\r\n- Resolved issues when comparing `BigInt` IDs when `relationMode=\"prisma\"` was enabled and Cloudflare D1 was being used.\r\n\r\n### Joins\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23742 fixes Prisma Client not supporting deeply nested `some` clauses when the `relationJoins` Preview feature was enabled.\r\n\r\n### MongoDB\r\n\r\nThe MongoDB driver for Rust (that our query engine users under the hood) had behavior that prioritized IPv4 connections over IPv6 connections. In IPv6-only environments, this could lead to significant \"cold starts\" where the query engine had to wait for IPv4 to fail before the driver would try IPv6. \r\n\r\nWith help from the MongoDB team, this has been resolved. The driver will now try IPv4 and IPv6 connections in parallel and then move forward with the first response. This should prevent cold start issues that have been seen with MongoDB in Prisma Accelerate.\r\n\r\nThank you to the MongoDB team!\r\n\r\n## Join us\r\n\r\nLooking to make an impact on Prisma in a big way? We're now hiring engineers for the ORM team!\r\n- [Senior Engineer (TypeScript)](https://boards.greenhouse.io/prisma/jobs/5350820002): This person will be primarily working on the TypeScript side and evolving our Prisma client. Rust knowledge (or desire to learn Rust) is a plus.\r\n- [Senior Engineer (Rust)](https://boards.greenhouse.io/prisma/jobs/6940273002): This person will be focused on the `prisma-engines` Rust codebase. TypeScript knowledge (or, again, a desire to learn) is a plus.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @mcuelenaere, @pagewang0, @Druue, @key-moon, @Jolg42, @pranayat, @ospfranco, @yubrot, @skyzh for helping!",

While sufficient in many cases, UUIDv4 has a few drawbacks, namely that it is not temporally sortable.\r\n\r\nUUIDv7 attempts to resolve this issue, making it easy to temporally sort your database rows by ID!\r\n\r\nTo support this, we\u2019ve updated the `uuid()` function in Prisma Schema to accept an optional, integer argument. Right now, the only valid values are `4` and `7`, with `4` being the default. \r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id   String @id @default(uuid()) // defaults to 4\r\n  name String\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id   String @id @default(uuid(4)) // same as above, but explicit\r\n  name String\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id   String @id @default(uuid(7)) // will use UUIDv7 instead of UUIDv4\r\n  name String\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bug squashing\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve squashed a number of bugs this release, special thanks to everyone who helped us! A few select highlights are:\r\n\r\n- [SQLite db will now be created and read from the correct location when using `prismaSchemaFolder`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/24779).\r\n- [Empty `Json[]` fields will now return `[]` instead of `null` when accessed through a join using the `relationJoins` Preview feature.](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22923)\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma\r\n\r\n- [Support UUID v7](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/24079)\r\n\r\n### Language tools (e.g. VS Code)\r\n\r\n- [Support fetching references for a model](https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/issues/982)\r\n\r\n## Share your feedback about Prisma ORM\r\n\r\nWe want to know how you like working with Prisma ORM in your projects! Please [take our 2min survey](https://pris.ly/orm-survey-5-18) and let us know what you like or where we can improve \ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @mcuelenaere, @pagewang0, @Druue, @key-moon, @Jolg42, @pranayat, @ospfranco, @yubrot, @skyzh, @haaawk for helping!",

If you need the ability to generally omit a field except in a specific query, you can also overwrite a global omit locally\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient({\r\n  omit: {\r\n    user: { \r\n      // password is omitted globally.\r\n      password: true,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst userWithPassword = await prisma.user.findUnique({\r\n  omit: { password: false }, // omit now false, so password is returned\r\n  where: { id: 1 },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes to `prismaSchemaFolder`\r\n\r\nIn `5.15.0` we released the `prismaSchemaFolder` Preview feature, allowing you to create multiple Prisma Schema files in a `prisma/schema` directory. We\u2019ve gotten [a lot of great feedback](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/24413) and are really excited with how the community has been using the feature.\r\n\r\nTo continue improving our multi-file schema support, **we have a few breaking changes** to the `prismaSchemaFolder` feature:\r\n\r\n- When using relative paths in Prisma Schema files with the `prismaSchemaFolder` feature, a path is now relative to the file it is defined in rather than relative to the `prisma/schema` folder. This means that if you have a generator block in `/project/prisma/schema/config/generator.prisma` with an `output` of `./foo` the output will be resolved to `/project/prisma/schema/config/foo` rather than `/project/prisma/foo`. The path to a SQLite file will be resolved in the same manner.\r\n- We realized that during migration many people would have `prisma/schema` as well as `prisma/schema.prisma`. Our initial implementation looked for a `.prisma` file first and would ignore the `schema` folder if it exists. This is now an error.\r\n\r\n### Changes to `fullTextSearch`\r\n\r\nIn order to improve our full-text search implementation **we have made a breaking change** to the `fullTextSearch` Preview feature.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when the feature was enabled we updated the `<Model>OrderByWithRelationInput` TypeScript type with the `<Model>OrderByWithRelationAndSearchRelevanceInput` type. However, we have noted that there are no cases where relational ordering is needed but search relevance is not. Thus, we have decided to remove the `<Model>OrderByWithRelationAndSearchRelevanceInput` naming and only use the `<Model>OrderByWithRelationInput` naming.\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma\r\n\r\n- [Wrong Parameterized Types Sent for SQL Server Queries](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17565)\r\n- [`Prisma has no exported member named OrderByWithRelationInput.

    "body": "Today, we are excited to share the\u00a0`5.15.0`\u00a0stable release\u00a0\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1f **Help us spread the word about Prisma by starring the repo or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20the%20latest%20@prisma%20release%20v5.15.0%20%F0%9F%9A%80%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/5.15.0) about the release.** \ud83c\udf1f\r\n\r\n## **Highlights**\r\n\r\n### Multi-File Prisma Schema support\r\n\r\nPrisma ORM 5.15.0 features support for multi-file Prisma Schema in Preview. \r\n\r\nThis closes [a long standing issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2377) and does so in a clean and easy to migrate way. \r\n\r\nTo get started: \r\n\r\n1. Enable the `prismaSchemaFolder` Preview feature by including it in the `previewFeatures` field of your `generator`.\r\n    ```prisma\r\n    datasource db {\r\n      provider = \"postgresql\"\r\n      url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    generator client {\r\n      provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n      previewFeatures = [\"prismaSchemaFolder\"]\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n2. Create a `schema` subdirectory under your `prisma` directory.\r\n3. Move your `schema.prisma` into this directory. \r\n\r\nYou are now set up with a multi-file Prisma Schema! Add as many or as few `.prisma` files to the new `prisma/schema` directory.\r\n\r\nWhen running commands where a Prisma Schema file is expected to be provided, you can now define a Prisma Schema directory. This includes Prisma CLI commands that use the `--schema` option as well as defining schema via `package.json`\r\n\r\nOur tooling has also been updated to handle multiple Prisma Schema files. This includes our Visual Studio Code extension and tools like database introspection, which will deposit new models in a `introspected.prisma` file. Existing models will be updated in the file they are found. \r\n\r\nTo learn more, please refer to our official documentation and [announcement blog post](https://www.prisma.io/blog/organize-your-prisma-schema-with-multi-file-support). If you try out `prismaSchemaFolder`, please [let us know](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/discussions/24413)!\r\n\r\n### Interesting Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n#### Fix for PostgreSQL prepared statement caching for raw queries\r\n\r\nThis release fixes a [nasty bug with the caching of prepared statements](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22482) in [raw Prisma Client queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries) that affected PostgreSQL when you ran the same SQL statement with differently typed paramters. This should not fail any more.\r\n\r\n#### Fix for SQL Server introspection of (deprecated) **`CREATE DEFAULT`**\r\n\r\nOur Introspection logic [crashed](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/24275) on encountering certain multi-line `CREATE DEFAULT`, a [deprecated way to define defaults in SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-default-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15). As many SQL Server users are working with established databases, this happened frequently enough that we now explicitly ignore these defaults instead of crashing.\r\n\r\n#### Fix for Cloudflare D1\u2019s lower parameter limit\r\n\r\nCloudflare\u2019s D1 has a lower parameter limit than local SQLite, which caused [bigger queries to fail](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23743). We adapted that limit to the D1 default for `@prisma/adapter-d1`, which will avoid such failures.\r\n\r\n#### Fix for Cloudflare D1\u2019s different `PRAGMA` support\r\n\r\nOur generated migration SQL for SQLite [did not always work for Cloudflare D1](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/24208), because of differences in the supported pragmas.

Please [take our 2min survey](https://pris.ly/orm/survey/release-5-14) and let us know what you like or where we can improve \ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\n### `createManyAndReturn()`\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re happy to announce the availability of a new, top-level Prisma Client query: `createManyAndReturn()`. It works similarly to `createMany()` but uses a `RETURNING` clause in the SQL query to retrieve the records that were just created.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an example of creating multiple posts and then immediately returning those posts.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst postBodies = req.json()['posts']\r\n\r\nconst posts = prisma.post.createManyAndReturn({\r\n  data: postBodies\r\n});\r\n\r\nreturn posts\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally,`createManyAndReturn()` supports the same options as `findMany()`, such as the ability to return only specific fields.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst postBodies = req.json()['posts']\r\n\r\nconst postTitles = prisma.post.createManyAndReturn({\r\n  data: postBodies,\r\n  select: {\r\n    title: true,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\nreturn postTitles\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull documentation for this feature can be found [in the Prisma Client API Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#createmanyandreturn).\r\n\r\n**Note**: Because `createManyAndReturn()` uses the `RETURNING` clause, it is only supported by PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, and SQLite databases. At this time, `relationLoadStrategy: join` is not supported in `createManyAndReturn()` queries.\r\n\r\n### MongoDB performance improvements\r\n\r\nPreviously, Prisma ORM suffered from performance issues when using the `in` operator or when including related models in queries against a MongoDB database. These queries were translated by the Prisma query engine in such a way that indexes were skipped and collection scans were used, leading to slower queries especially on large datasets.\r\n\r\nWith 5.14.0, Prisma ORM now rewrites queries to use a combination of `$or` and `$eq` operators, leading to dramatic performance increases for queries that include `in` operators or relation loading.\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma Client\r\n\r\n- [`createMany()` should return the created records](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/8131)\r\n- [Generating Prisma client without any model in its schema](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/11582)\r\n- [MongoDB: Performance issue with nested `take` on many-to-one relationship](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/13865)\r\n- [Slow queries on MongoDB using `include` for relations](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/15156)\r\n- [[MongoDB] Performance issue in `findMany()` query execution with `in`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/15983)\r\n- [MongoDB nested/`include` query slow](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17142)\r\n- [MongoDB Connector generates queries which do not take advantage of indices.](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/17396)\r\n- [Mongodb Nested Queries Not Using Indexes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18025)\r\n- [MongoDB slow delete with `onDelete: SetNull`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19169)\r\n- [Slow query with many-to-one relationship on MongoDB](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20600)\r\n- [`prisma init --with-model`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20915)\r\n- [Fixed version of `@opentelemetry/*` dependencies](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/21473)\r\n- [Usage of deprecated punycode module](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/21644)\r\n- [Bug: D1 One-to-Many Relation INSERTs fail with `The required connected records were not found.` when using indices](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23902)\r\n\r\n### Prisma Migrate\r\n\r\n- [Empty `dbgenerated()` still breaking for `Unsupported()` types](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/15654)\r\n- [Validation error when `shadowDatabaseUrl` is identical to `url` (or `directUrl`)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/16628)\r\n- [MongoDB Query with 'in' condition will cause COLLSCAN, without leveraging indexes](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19955)\r\n- [\"Not Authorised\" when directly applying Prisma generated migrations to Cloudflare D1 with `PRAGMA foreign_key_check;`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23827)\r\n\r\n### Language tools (e.g. VS Code)\r\n\r\n- [make superior: model generate](https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/issues/1651)\r\n- [Missing code autocomplete for referential actions with mongodb](https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/issues/1676)\r\n- [add codelens provider w/ generate client command](https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/pull/1710)\r\n\r\n## Company news\r\n\r\n### Prisma Changelog\r\n\r\nCurious about all things Prisma?

The [highly-requested](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5042) `omit` feature now allows you to exclude fields that you don\u2019t want to retrieve from the database on a ***per-query basis*.** \r\n\r\nBy default, when a query returns records, the result includes all scalar fields of the models defined in the Prisma schema. [`select`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#select) can be used to return specific fields, while `omit` can now be used to exclude specific fields. `omit` lives at the same API level and works on all of the same [Prisma Client model queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#model-queries) as `select`. Note, however, that `omit` and `select` are mutually exclusive. In other words, you can\u2019t use both in the same query. \r\n\r\nTo get started using `omit`, enable the `omitApi` Preview feature in your Prisma schema:\r\n\r\n```prisma\r\n// schema.prisma\r\ngenerator client {\r\n  provider        = \"prisma-client-js\"\r\n  previewFeatures = [\"omitApi\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe sure to re-generate Prisma Client afterwards:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx prisma generate\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example of using `omit`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Includes all fields except password\r\nawait prisma.user.findMany({\r\n  omit: {\r\n   password: true\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example of using `omit` with `include`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Includes all user fields except user's password and title of user's posts\r\nawait prisma.user.findMany({\r\n  omit: {\r\n   password: true\r\n  },\r\n  include: {\r\n    posts: {\r\n      omit: {\r\n        title: true\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n<details>\r\n\t<summary>Expand to view the example Prisma schema</summary>\r\n\r\n```prisma\r\nmodel User {\r\n  id       Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\r\n  email    String  @unique\r\n  name     String?\r\n  password String\r\n  posts    Post[]\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodel Post {\r\n  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())\r\n  title    String\r\n  author   User   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\r\n  authorId Int\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>    \r\n\r\nMany users have requested a global implementation of `omit`. This request will be accommodated in the future.

This can be really useful when seeding your database or inserting bulk data.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of using `createMany()` to create new users:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst users = await prisma.user.createMany({\r\n  data: [\r\n    { name: 'Sonali', email: 'sonali@prisma.io' },\r\n    { name: 'Alex', email: 'alex@prisma.io' },\r\n    { name: 'Yewande', email: 'yewande@prisma.io' },\r\n    { name: 'Angelina', email: 'angelina@prisma.io' },\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this release, if you wanted to perform bulk inserts with SQLite, you would have most likely used `$queryRawUnsafe` to execute raw SQL queries. But now you don\u2019t have to go through all that trouble \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nWith SQLite, `createMany()` works exactly the same way from an API standpoint as it does with other databases except it does not support the `skipDuplicates` option. At the behavior level, SQLite will split `createMany()` entries into multiple `INSERT` queries when the model in your schema contains fields with attributes like `@default(dbgenerated())` or `@default(autoincrement())`  and when the fields are not consistently provided with values across the entries.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcda**Documentation:** [`createMany()` - Prisma Client API Reference](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-client-reference#createmany)\r\n\r\n## Fixes and Improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma Client\r\n\r\n- [N+1 Issue with `Decimal` data type and combining queries (batching)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/5952)\r\n- [Batched `findUnique()`  error out when the field is of `Boolean` type](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22384)\r\n- [`relationJoins` MySQL converts nested Decimal to float](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23233)\r\n- [Unexpected query leading to querying full table when using batched `findUnique()`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23343)\r\n- [`node-postgres` (pg) errors with misleading `P2010 PrismaClientKnownRequestError` when using `@prisma/adapter-pg` with SSL (`?sslmode=require`)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23390)\r\n- [D1 DateTime type does not work](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23479)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to @yubrot, @skyzh, @anuraaga, @onichandame, @LucianBuzzo, @RobertCraigie, @arthurfiorette, @elithrar for helping!",

As of this release, these nested `create` queries are optimized and the `INSERT` queries are sent to the database _in bulk_ in a single roundtrip. These optimizations apply to one-to-many as well as many-to-many relations.\r\n\r\nWith this change, using the nested `create` option to create multiple records effectively becomes equivalent to using a nested `createMany` operation (except that `createMany` _only_ works with one-to-many relations, whereas `create` works both with one-to-many and many-to-many).\r\n\r\n> **Note**: Only the deepest nested operation is optimized. If a user specified `create (1) -> create (2) -> create (3)`  in their query, only `create (3)` will be optimized.\r\n\r\n## Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n### Prisma Client\r\n\r\n- [Prisma errors when not using the major.minor.patch versioning system](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7317)\r\n- [mongodb where condition resulted in combined $ne but should not be $eq](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/15175)\r\n- [Node hangs when `console.log(new PrismaClient())`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18292)\r\n- [Add wolfy linux to supported OS](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18329)\r\n- [Support Linux Gentoo](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18698)\r\n- [Know engines to download for Void Linux](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20434)\r\n- [Engine does not support Linux distro \"openeuler\"](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/20937)\r\n- [Prisma Doesn't Recognize Crystal Linux distro](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/21955)\r\n- [Regression: Mapped `enum` throws error (collation `cp1250_czech_cs` or similar)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/21967)\r\n- [`NOT` condition leaks out of its desired bounds](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22007)\r\n- [The column does not exist in the current database.](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22098)\r\n- [Logging `PrismaClient` object is slow](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22848)\r\n- [Running `prisma generate` on Litespeed Web Server cPanel with ssh](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22857)\r\n- [Prisma doesn't know which engines to download for the Linux distro \"guttaos\"](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23031)\r\n- [Error in driver-adapter-utils with `tsc`:  `Cannot find namespace 'debug'.`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23091)\r\n- [VS Code debugger freeze from time to time, when Prisma Client is involved](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23181)\r\n- [`push` method still unimplemented for scalar lists in CockroachDB](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23183)\r\n- [`Invalid character` error persists on 5.10.1 in Prisma Studio](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23225)\r\n- [Add \"Peppermint OS\" to list of supported distros](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23237)\r\n- [`runtimeDescription` is not defined error](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23430)\r\n\r\n### Prisma Migrate\r\n\r\n- [Prisma with UOS or Deepin](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18374)\r\n- [Warning: Linux distro \"slackware\"](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/18547)\r\n- [Error when run `npx prisma db pull` with DeepinOS 20.9GNU/LInux](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/19157)\r\n- [Add solus to list of known supported distros](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/21493)\r\n- [NixOS not recognised as a Linux distribution](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22145)\r\n- [Prisma Warning on Ubuntu 20.04](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22347)\r\n- [Let Prisma detect Artix Linux distro](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22522)\r\n- [couldn't identify clear-linux-os](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/22539)\r\n- [Prisma doesn't know which engines to download with `Linux Mint`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23141)\r\n- [`Error: Invalid character` when `schema.prisma` includes Chinese/Non-ASCII characters in a comment](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23201)\r\n\r\n### Prisma Engines\r\n\r\n- [[DA]\u00a0Planetscale engine tests: aggregations](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4473)\r\n- [[DA]\u00a0Planetscale engine tests: json filtering](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4475)\r\n- [[DA]\u00a0Planetscale engine tests: order and pagination](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4478)\r\n- [[DA]\u00a0Planetscale engine tests: oids](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4479)\r\n- [[DA]\u00a0Planetscale engine tests: nested_createmany_fail_dups](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4481)\r\n- [[DA]\u00a0Planetscale engine tests: create_many_error_dups](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4484)\r\n- [[DA]\u00a0Planetscale engine tests: upsert_fails_if_filter_dont_match](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/issues/4486)\r\n",
