This reduces the chance of having conflicting versions of `@testing-library/dom` installed that frequently caused bugs when used with `@testing-library/user-event`. We will also be able to allow new versions of `@testing-library/dom` being used without a SemVer major release of `@testing-library/react` by just widening the peer dependency.\r\n`@types/react-dom` needs to be installed if you're typechecking files using `@testing-library/react`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
