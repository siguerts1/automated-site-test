Modules listed in your package.json's `\"dependencies\"` and `\"peerDependencies\"` will be linked as imports/require statements  (thanks @Andarist)\r\n- Importing subdirectories from packages now treats them as external (#83, thanks @Andarist)\r\n- When builds fail, actually output some useful information (#120, thanks @jesstelford)\r\n- Output much more helpful Rollup errors (#128, thanks @gribnoysup)\r\n- Fix error reporting in watch mode and make fatal watch errors exit with an error code (#153, thanks @mattdesl)\r\n- Minify CSS assets with cssnano (#121, thanks @nicksrandall)\r\n- Add `.tsx` support! (thanks @jaredpalmer)\r\n- Updated to Rollup 0.60+\r\n- watch mode can now also be activated via a `--watch` flag (thanks @ngryman)\r\n"
