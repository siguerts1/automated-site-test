See `#25956` for more\r\n    details.\r\n  * Added low-level reduction APIs in {mod}`jax.lax`: `jax.lax.reduce_sum`,\r\n    `jax.lax.reduce_prod`, `jax.lax.reduce_max`, `jax.lax.reduce_min`,\r\n    `jax.lax.reduce_and`, `jax.lax.reduce_or`, and `jax.lax.reduce_xor`.\r\n  * `jax.lax.linalg.qr`, and `jax.scipy.linalg.qr`, now support\r\n    column-pivoting on CPU and GPU. See #20282 and\r\n    #25955 for more details.\r\n\r\n* Changes\r\n  * `JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION` and `JAX_NUM_CPU_DEVICES` now work as\r\n    env vars. Before they could only be specified via jax.config or flags.\r\n  * `JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION` now defaults to `'gloo'`, meaning\r\n    multi-process CPU communication works out-of-the-box.\r\n  * The `jax[tpu]` TPU extra no longer depends on the `libtpu-nightly` package.\r\n    This package may safely be removed if it is present on your machine; JAX now\r\n    uses `libtpu` instead.\r\n\r\n* Deprecations\r\n  * The internal function `linear_util.wrap_init` and the constructor\r\n    `core.Jaxpr` now must take a non-empty `core.DebugInfo` kwarg. For\r\n    a limited time, a `DeprecationWarning` is printed if\r\n    `jax.extend.linear_util.wrap_init` is used without debugging info.\r\n    A downstream effect of this several other internal functions need debug\r\n    info. This change does not affect public APIs.\r\n    See https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues/26480 for more detail.\r\n\r\n* Bug fixes\r\n  * TPU runtime startup and shutdown time should be significantly improved on\r\n    TPU v5e and newer (from around 17s to around 8s). If not already set, you may\r\n    need to enable transparent hugepages in your VM image\r\n    (`sudo sh -c 'echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled'`).\r\n    We hope to improve this further in future releases.\r\n  * Persistent compilation cache no longer writes access time file if\r\n    `JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` is unset or set to -1, i.e. if the LRU\r\n    eviction policy isn't enabled. This should improve performance when using\r\n    the cache with large-scale network storage.",

    "body": "As of this release, JAX now uses [effort-based versioning](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jep/25516-effver.html).\r\nSince this release makes a breaking change to PRNG key semantics that\r\nmay require users to update their code, we are bumping the \"meso\" version of JAX\r\nto signify this.\r\n\r\n* Breaking changes\r\n  * Enable `jax_threefry_partitionable` by default (see\r\n    [the update note](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/discussions/18480)).\r\n\r\n  * This release drops support for Mac x86 wheels. Mac ARM of course remains\r\n    supported. For a recent discussion, see https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/discussions/22936.\r\n\r\n    Two key factors motivated this decision:\r\n    * The Mac x86 build (only) has a number of test failures and crashes. We\r\n      would prefer to ship no release than a broken release.\r\n    * Mac x86 hardware is end-of-life and cannot be easily obtained for\r\n      developers at this point. So it is difficult for us to fix this kind of\r\n      problem even if we wanted to.\r\n\r\n    We are open to readding support for Mac x86 if the community is willing\r\n    to help support that platform: in particular, we would need the JAX test\r\n    suite to pass cleanly on Mac x86 before we could ship releases again.\r\n\r\n* Changes:\r\n  * The minimum NumPy version is now 1.25. NumPy 1.25 will remain the minimum\r\n    supported version until June 2025.\r\n  * The minimum SciPy version is now 1.11. SciPy 1.11 will remain the minimum\r\n    supported version until June 2025.\r\n  * `jax.numpy.einsum` now defaults to `optimize='auto'` rather than\r\n    `optimize='optimal'`. This avoids exponentially-scaling trace-time in\r\n    the case of many arguments (`#25214`).\r\n  * `jax.numpy.linalg.solve` no longer supports batched 1D arguments\r\n    on the right hand side. To recover the previous behavior in these cases,\r\n    use `solve(a, b[..., None]).squeeze(-1)`.\r\n\r\n* New Features\r\n  * `jax.numpy.fft.fftn`, `jax.numpy.fft.rfftn`,\r\n    `jax.numpy.fft.ifftn`, and `jax.numpy.fft.irfftn` now support\r\n    transforms in more than 3 dimensions, which was previously the limit. See\r\n    `#25606` for more details.\r\n  * Support added for user defined state in the FFI via the new\r\n    `jax.ffi.register_ffi_type_id` function.\r\n  * The AOT lowering `.as_text()` method now supports the `debug_info` option\r\n    to include debugging information, e.g., source location, in the output.\r\n\r\n* Deprecations\r\n  * From `jax.interpreters.xla`, `abstractify` and `pytype_aval_mappings`\r\n    are now deprecated, having been replaced by symbols of the same name\r\n    in `jax.core`.\r\n  * `jax.scipy.special.lpmn` and `jax.scipy.special.lpmn_values`\r\n    are deprecated, following their deprecation in SciPy v1.15.0. There are\r\n    no plans to replace these deprecated functions with new APIs.\r\n  * The `jax.extend.ffi` submodule was moved to `jax.ffi`, and the\r\n    previous import path is deprecated.\r\n\r\n* Deletions\r\n  * `jax_enable_memories` flag has been deleted and the behavior of that flag\r\n    is on by default.\r\n  * From `jax.lib.xla_client`, the previously-deprecated `Device` and\r\n    `XlaRuntimeError` symbols have been removed; instead use `jax.Device`\r\n    and `jax.errors.JaxRuntimeError` respectively.\r\n  * The `jax.experimental.array_api` module has been removed after being\r\n    deprecated in JAX v0.4.32. Since that release, `jax.numpy` supports\r\n    the array API directly.\r\n",

    "body": "* Breaking Changes\r\n  * This release lands \"stackless\", an internal change to JAX's tracing\r\n    machinery. We made trace dispatch purely a function of context rather than a\r\n    function of both context and data. This let us delete a lot of machinery for\r\n    managing data-dependent tracing: levels, sublevels, `post_process_call`,\r\n    `new_base_main`, `custom_bind`, and so on. The change should only affect\r\n    users that use JAX internals.\r\n\r\n    If you do use JAX internals then you may need to\r\n    update your code (see\r\n    https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/commit/c36e1f7c1ad4782060cbc8e8c596d85dfb83986f\r\n    for clues about how to do this). There might also be version skew\r\n    issues with JAX libraries that do this. If you find this change breaks your\r\n    non-JAX-internals-using code then try the\r\n    `config.jax_data_dependent_tracing_fallback` flag as a workaround, and if\r\n    you need help updating your code then please file a bug.\r\n  * `jax.experimental.jax2tf.convert` with `native_serialization=False`\r\n    or with `enable_xla=False` have been deprecated since July 2024, with\r\n    JAX version 0.4.31. Now we removed support for these use cases. `jax2tf`\r\n    with native serialization will still be supported.\r\n  * In `jax.interpreters.xla`, the `xb`, `xc`, and `xe` symbols have been removed\r\n    after being deprecated in JAX v0.4.31. Instead use `xb = jax.lib.xla_bridge`,\r\n    `xc = jax.lib.xla_client`, and `xe = jax.lib.xla_extension`.\r\n  * The deprecated module `jax.experimental.export` has been removed. It was replaced\r\n    by `jax.export` in JAX v0.4.30. See the [migration guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/export/export.html#migration-guide-from-jax-experimental-export)\r\n    for information on migrating to the new API.\r\n  * The `initial` argument to `jax.nn.softmax` and `jax.nn.log_softmax`\r\n    has been removed, after being deprecated in v0.4.27.\r\n  * Calling `np.asarray` on typed PRNG keys (i.e. keys produced by `jax.random.key`)\r\n    now raises an error. Previously, this returned a scalar object array.\r\n  * The following deprecated methods and functions in `jax.export` have\r\n    been removed:\r\n      * `jax.export.DisabledSafetyCheck.shape_assertions`: it had no effect\r\n        already.\r\n      * `jax.export.Exported.lowering_platforms`: use `platforms`.\r\n      * `jax.export.Exported.mlir_module_serialization_version`:\r\n        use `calling_convention_version`.\r\n      * `jax.export.Exported.uses_shape_polymorphism`:\r\n         use `uses_global_constants`.\r\n      * the `lowering_platforms` kwarg for `jax.export.export`: use\r\n        `platforms` instead.\r\n  * The kwargs `symbolic_scope` and `symbolic_constraints` from\r\n    `jax.export.symbolic_args_specs` have been removed. They were\r\n    deprecated in June 2024. Use `scope` and `constraints` instead.\r\n  * Hashing of tracers, which has been deprecated since version 0.4.30, now\r\n    results in a `TypeError`.\r\n  * Refactor: JAX build CLI (build/build.py) now uses a subcommand structure and\r\n    replaces previous build.py usage. Run `python build/build.py --help` for\r\n    more details. Brief overview of the new subcommand options:\r\n    * `build`: Builds JAX wheel packages. For e.g., `python build/build.py build --wheels=jaxlib,jax-cuda-pjrt`\r\n    * `requirements_update`: Updates requirements_lock.txt files.\r\n  * `jax.scipy.linalg.toeplitz` now does implicit batching on multi-dimensional\r\n    inputs. To recover the previous behavior, you can call `jax.numpy.ravel`\r\n    on the function inputs.\r\n  * `jax.scipy.special.gamma` and `jax.scipy.special.gammasgn` now\r\n    return NaN for negative integer inputs, to match the behavior of SciPy from\r\n    https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/21827.\r\n  * `jax.clear_backends` was removed after being deprecated in v0.4.26.\r\n  * We removed the custom call \"__gpu$xla.gpu.triton\" from the list of custom\r\n    call that we guarantee export stability. This is because this custom call\r\n    relies on Triton IR, which is not guaranteed to be stable. If you need\r\n    to export code that uses this custom call, you can use the `disabled_checks`\r\n    parameter. See more details in the [documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/export/export.html#compatibility-guarantees-for-custom-calls).\r\n\r\n* New Features\r\n  * `jax.jit` got a new `compiler_options: dict[str, Any]` argument, for\r\n    passing compilation options to XLA. For the moment it's undocumented and\r\n    may be in flux.\r\n  * `jax.tree_util.register_dataclass` now allows metadata fields to be\r\n    declared inline via `dataclasses.field`. See the function documentation\r\n    for examples.\r\n  * Added `jax.numpy.put_along_axis`.\r\n  * `jax.lax.linalg.eig` and the related `jax.numpy` functions\r\n    (`jax.numpy.linalg.eig` and `jax.numpy.linalg.eigvals`) are now\r\n    supported on GPU. See #24663 for more details.\r\n  * Added two new configuration flags, `jax_exec_time_optimization_effort` and `jax_memory_fitting_effort`, to control the amount of effort the compiler spends minimizing execution time and memory usage, respectively.  Valid values are between -1.0 and 1.0, default is 0.0.\r\n\r\n* Bug fixes\r\n  * Fixed a bug where the GPU implementations of LU and QR decomposition would\r\n    result in an indexing overflow for batch sizes close to int32 max. See\r\n    #24843 for more details.\r\n\r\n* Deprecations\r\n  * `jax.lib.xla_extension.ArrayImpl` and `jax.lib.xla_client.ArrayImpl` are deprecated;\r\n    use `jax.Array` instead.\r\n  * `jax.lib.xla_extension.XlaRuntimeError` is deprecated; use `jax.errors.JaxRuntimeError`\r\n    instead.\r\n",

For the next few releases JAX will pin an empty version of\r\n    `libtpu-nightly` as well as `libtpu` to ease the transition; that dependency\r\n    will be removed in Q1 2025.\r\n\r\n* Deprecations:\r\n  * The semi-public API `jax.lib.xla_client.PaddingType` has been deprecated.\r\n    No JAX APIs consume this type, so there is no replacement.\r\n  * The default behavior of `jax.pure_callback` and\r\n    `jax.extend.ffi.ffi_call` under `vmap` has been deprecated and so has\r\n    the `vectorized` parameter to those functions. The `vmap_method` parameter\r\n    should be used instead for better defined behavior. See the discussion in\r\n    `#23881` for more details.\r\n  * The semi-public API `jax.lib.xla_client.register_custom_call_target` has\r\n    been deprecated.

    "body": "* New Functionality\r\n  * This release includes wheels for Python 3.13. Free-threading mode is not yet\r\n    supported.\r\n  * `jax.errors.JaxRuntimeError` has been added as a public alias for the\r\n    formerly private `XlaRuntimeError` type.\r\n\r\n* Breaking changes\r\n  * `jax_pmap_no_rank_reduction` flag is set to `True` by default.\r\n    * `array[0]` on a pmap result now introduces a reshape (use `array[0:1]`\r\n      instead).\r\n    * The per-shard shape (accessable via `jax_array.addressable_shards` or\r\n      `jax_array.addressable_data(0))` now has a leading `(1, ...)`. Update code\r\n      that directly accesses shards accordingly. The rank of the per-shard-shape\r\n      now matches that of the global shape which is the same behavior as jit.\r\n      This avoids costly reshapes when passing results from pmap into jit.\r\n  * `jax.experimental.host_callback` has been deprecated since March 2024, with\r\n    JAX version 0.4.26. Now we set the default value of the\r\n    `--jax_host_callback_legacy` configuration value to `True`, which means that\r\n    if your code uses `jax.experimental.host_callback` APIs, those API calls\r\n    will be implemented in terms of the new `jax.experimental.io_callback` API.\r\n    If this breaks your code, for a very limited time, you can set the\r\n    `--jax_host_callback_legacy` to `True`. Soon we will remove that\r\n    configuration option, so you should instead transition to using the\r\n    new JAX callback APIs. See #20385 for a discussion.\r\n\r\n* Deprecations\r\n  * In `jax.numpy.trim_zeros`, non-arraylike arguments or arraylike\r\n    arguments with `ndim != 1` are now deprecated, and in the future will result\r\n    in an error.\r\n  * Internal pretty-printing tools `jax.core.pp_*` have been removed, after\r\n    being deprecated in JAX v0.4.30.\r\n  * `jax.lib.xla_client.Device` is deprecated; use `jax.Device` instead.\r\n  * `jax.lib.xla_client.XlaRuntimeError` has been deprecated. Use\r\n    `jax.errors.JaxRuntimeError` instead.\r\n\r\n* Deletion:\r\n  * `jax.xla_computation` is deleted. It has been 3 months since its deprecation\r\n    in 0.4.30 JAX release.\r\n    Please use the AOT APIs to get the same functionality as `jax.xla_computation`.\r\n    * `jax.xla_computation(fn)(*args, **kwargs)` can be replaced with\r\n      `jax.jit(fn).lower(*args, **kwargs).compiler_ir('hlo')`.\r\n    * You can also use `.out_info` property of `jax.stages.Lowered` to get the\r\n      output information (like tree structure, shape and dtype).\r\n    * For cross-backend lowering, you can replace\r\n      `jax.xla_computation(fn, backend='tpu')(*args, **kwargs)` with\r\n      `jax.jit(fn).trace(*args, **kwargs).lower(lowering_platforms=('tpu',)).compiler_ir('hlo')`.\r\n  * `jax.ShapeDtypeStruct` no longer accepts the `named_shape` argument.\r\n    The argument was only used by `xmap` which was removed in 0.4.31.\r\n  * `jax.tree.map(f, None, non-None)`, which previously emitted a\r\n    `DeprecationWarning`, now raises an error. `None`\r\n    is only a tree-prefix of itself. To preserve the current behavior, you can\r\n    ask `jax.tree.map` to treat `None` as a leaf value by writing:\r\n    `jax.tree.map(lambda x, y: None if x is None else f(x, y), a, b, is_leaf=lambda x: x is None)`.\r\n  * `jax.sharding.XLACompatibleSharding` has been removed. Please use\r\n    `jax.sharding.Sharding`.\r\n\r\n* Bug fixes\r\n  * Fixed a bug where `jax.numpy.cumsum` would produce incorrect outputs\r\n    if a non-boolean input was provided and `dtype=bool` was specified.\r\n  * Edit implementation of `jax.numpy.ldexp` to get correct gradient.",

Future releases will use the CUDA\r\n    plugin jaxlib (e.g. `pip install jax[cuda12]`).\r\n  * JAX now requires ml_dtypes version 0.4.0 or newer.\r\n  * Removed backwards-compatibility support for old usage of the\r\n    `jax.experimental.export` API. It is not possible anymore to use\r\n    `from jax.experimental.export import export`, and instead you should use\r\n    `from jax.experimental import export`.\r\n    The removed functionality has been deprecated since 0.4.24.\r\n\r\n* Deprecations\r\n  * `jax.sharding.XLACompatibleSharding` is deprecated. Please use\r\n    `jax.sharding.Sharding`.\r\n  * `jax.experimental.Exported.in_shardings` has been renamed as\r\n    `jax.experimental.Exported.in_shardings_hlo`. Same for `out_shardings`.\r\n    The old names will be removed after 3 months.\r\n  * Removed a number of previously-deprecated APIs:\r\n    * from {mod}`jax.core`: `non_negative_dim`, `DimSize`, `Shape`\r\n    * from {mod}`jax.lax`: `tie_in`\r\n    * from {mod}`jax.nn`: `normalize`\r\n    * from {mod}`jax.interpreters.xla`: `backend_specific_translations`,\r\n      `translations`, `register_translation`, `xla_destructure`,\r\n      `TranslationRule`, `TranslationContext`, `XlaOp`.\r\n  * The ``tol`` argument of {func}`jax.numpy.linalg.matrix_rank` is being\r\n    deprecated and will soon be removed. Use `rtol` instead.\r\n  * The ``rcond`` argument of {func}`jax.numpy.linalg.pinv` is being\r\n    deprecated and will soon be removed. Use `rtol` instead.\r\n  * The deprecated `jax.config` submodule has been removed. To configure JAX\r\n    use `import jax` and then reference the config object via `jax.config`.\r\n  * {mod}`jax.random` APIs no longer accept batched keys, where previously\r\n    some did unintentionally. Going forward, we recommend explicit use of\r\n    {func}`jax.vmap` in such cases.\r\n\r\n* New Functionality\r\n  * Added {func}`jax.experimental.Exported.in_shardings_jax` to construct\r\n    shardings that can be used with the JAX APIs from the HloShardings\r\n    that are stored in the `Exported` objects.",
