To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.*\r\n\r\n## Limitations and call for contribution!\r\n\r\nWe are super happy to make this code community-powered, and would love to see how you can help optimize the following: \r\n\r\n- current implementation uses the \"naive\" attention compution (so not really MLA)\r\n- current implementation loops through the experts. This should be replaced. Pointers to use `get_packed_weights` from `intetrations/tensor_parallel`. \r\n- current implementation uses the eleuther formula for ROPE, using the orginal one would be more efficient! (should still follow our API)\r\n- static cache is not supported (this should be just a generation config issue / config shape issues)\r\n\r\n### Usage tips\r\n\r\nThe model uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures for efficient inference and cost-effective training. It employs an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and multi-token prediction training objective. The model can be used for various language tasks after being pre-trained on 14.8 trillion tokens and going through Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages.\r\n\r\nYou can run the model in `FP8` automatically, using 2 nodes of 8 H100 should be more than enough! \r\n\r\n```python\r\n# `run_deepseek_v1.py`\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\nimport torch\r\ntorch.manual_seed(30)\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"deepseek-r1\")\r\n\r\nchat = [\r\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"},\r\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"I'm doing great. How can I help you today?\"},\r\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I'd like to show off how chat templating works!\"},\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"deepseek-r1\", device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)\r\ninputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\r\n\r\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=50)\r\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs))\r\n```\r\nThis generated: \r\n\r\n``````\r\n<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\r\nOkay, the user wants to demonstrate how chat templating works. Let me break down what that means. Chat templating is about structuring the conversation data, especially for models that need specific input formats. Maybe they're referring to something like how messages are formatted with roles (user, assistant, system) in APIs like OpenAI.\r\n\r\nFirst, I should explain what chat templating is. It's the process of formatting conversation data into a structured format that the model can understand. This usually includes roles and content. For example, user messages, assistant responses, and system messages each have their own role tags.\r\n\r\nThey might want an example. Let me think of a simple conversation. The user says \"Hello, how are you?\" and the assistant responds \"I'm doing great. How can I help you today?\" Then the user follows up with wanting to show off chat templating. So the example should include the history and the new message.\r\n\r\nIn some frameworks, like Hugging Face's Transformers, chat templates are applied using Jinja2 templates. The template might look something like combining system messages, then looping through user and assistant messages with appropriate tags. For instance, using {% for message in messages %} and assigning roles like <|user|>, <|assistant|>, etc.\r\n\r\nI should structure the example with the messages array, showing each role and content. Then apply a hypothetical template to convert that into a formatted string the model uses. Also, mention that different models have different templating requirements, like using special tokens or varying role labels.\r\n\r\nWait, the user mentioned \"chat templating\" in the context of showing off. Maybe they want a practical example they can present. So providing a code snippet or a structured data example would be helpful. Let me outline a typical messages array and then the templated output.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's important to note that proper templating ensures the model knows the conversation flow, which is crucial for generating coherent responses. Maybe include a note about why it's important, like maintaining context and role-specific processing.\r\n\r\nLet me check if there are any common mistakes or things to avoid. For example, not closing tags properly, or mismatching roles. But maybe that's too detailed unless the user asks. Focus on the positive example first.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together, the response should have an example messages array, the applied template, and the final formatted string. Maybe use angle brackets or special tokens as placeholders. Also, mention that this helps in training or fine-tuning models with structured data.\r\n\r\nI think that's a solid approach. Let me structure it step by step to make it clear.\r\n</think>\r\n\r\nChat templating is a way to structure conversation data (e.g., user/assistant interactions) into a format that language models understand. This is especially important for models trained to handle multi-turn dialogues, where the input must explicitly separate roles (user, assistant, system, etc.) and messages. Let\u2019s break this down with an example!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Step 1: Raw Conversation History**\r\nSuppose we have this conversation:\r\n- **User**: \"Hello, how are you?\"\r\n- **Assistant**: \"I'm doing great. How can I help you today?\"\r\n- **User**: \"I'd like to show off how chat templating works!\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Step 2: Structured Messages**\r\nIn frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI, conversations are often formatted as a list of dictionaries with `role` and `content`:\r\n```python\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"},\r\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"I'm doing great. How can I help you today?\"},\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I'd like to show off how chat templating works!\"},\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Step 3: Apply a Chat Template**\r\nA **chat template** converts this structured data into a single string formatted for the model. For example, using a Jinja-style template (common in Hugging Face):\r\n\r\n```jinja\r\n{% for message in messages %}\r\n    {% if message['role'] == 'user' %}\r\n        <|user|>{{ message['content'] }}<|end|>\r\n    {% elif message['role'] == 'assistant' %}\r\n        <|assistant|>{{ message['content'] }}<|end|>\r\n    {% endif %}\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n<|assistant|>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Step 4: Final Templated Output**\r\nApplying the template to our `messages` list would produce:\r\n```text\r\n<|user|>Hello, how are you?<|end|>\r\n<|assistant|>I'm doing great. How can I help you today?<|end|>\r\n<|user|>I'd like to show off how chat templating works!<|end|>\r\n<|assistant|>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tells the model:  \r\n1. The conversation history (user/assistant turns).  \r\n2. The model\u2019s turn to generate a response (`<|assistant|>` at the end).  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Key Notes**:\r\n- **Role Separation**: Tags like `<|user|>` and `<|assistant|>` help the model distinguish speakers.\r\n- **Special Tokens**: Models often use unique tokens (e.g., `<|end|>`) to mark message boundaries.\r\n- **Flexibility**: Templates vary by model (e.g., OpenAI uses `{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}` instead of tags).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Why This Matters**:\r\n- **Consistency**: Ensures the model understands dialogue structure.\r\n- **Context Preservation**: Maintains the flow of multi-turn conversations.\r\n- **Alignment**: Matches the format the model was trained on for better performance.\r\n\r\nWant to dive deeper or see a specific framework\u2019s implementation (e.g., OpenAI, Llama, Mistral)? Let me know! \ud83d\ude0a<\uff5cend\u2581of\u2581sentence\uff5c>\r\n``````\r\n\r\nUse the following to run it\r\n```bash\r\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0|1 --rdzv-id an_id --rdzv-backend c10d --rdzv-endpoint master_addr:master_port run_deepseek_r1.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have: \r\n```bash\r\n[rank0]: ncclInternalError: Internal check failed.\r\n[rank0]: Last error:\r\n[rank0]: Bootstrap : no socket interface found\r\n```\r\nerror, it means NCCL was probably not loaded.

    "body": "# Release v4.50.0\r\n\r\n## New Model Additions\r\n\r\n### Model-based releases\r\n\r\nStarting with version v4.49.0, we have been doing model-based releases, additionally to our traditional, software-based monthly releases. These model-based releases provide a tag from which models may be installed.\r\n\r\nContrarily to our software-releases; these are not pushed to pypi and are kept on our GitHub. Each release has a tag attributed to it, such as:\r\n- `v4.49.0-Gemma-3`\r\n- `v4.49.0-AyaVision`\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f As bugs are identified and fixed on each model, the release tags are updated so that installing from that tag always gives the best experience possible with that model. \r\n\r\nEach new model release will always be based on the current state of the main branch at the time of its creation. This ensures that new models start with the latest features and fixes available.\r\n\r\nFor example, if two models\u2014Gemma-3 and AyaVision\u2014are released from main, and then a fix for gemma3 is merged, it will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n              o---- v4.49.0-Gemma-3 (includes AyaVision, plus main fixes)\r\n            /                  \\  \r\n---o--o--o--o--o-- (fix for gemma3) --o--o--o main\r\n       \\          \r\n        o---- v4.49.0-AyaVision\r\n```\r\nWe strive to merge model specific fixes on their respective branches as fast as possible! \r\n\r\n### Gemma 3\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b7f31b3-02bd-496a-9d4e-a1867bd6d9d4)\r\n\r\nGemma 3 is heavily referenced in the following [model-based release](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.49.0-Gemma-3) and we recommend reading these if you want all the information relative to that model.\r\n\r\nThe Gemma 3 model was proposed by Google. It is a vision-language model composed by a [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/siglip) vision encoder and a [Gemma 2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gemma_2) language decoder linked by a multimodal linear projection.\r\n\r\nIt cuts an image into a fixed number of tokens same way as Siglip if the image does not exceed certain aspect ratio. For images that exceed the given aspect ratio, it crops the image into multiple smaller pacthes and concatenates them with the base image embedding.\r\n\r\nOne particularity is that the model uses bidirectional attention on all the image tokens. Also, the model interleaves sliding window local attention with full causal attention in the language backbone, where each sixth layer is a full causal attention layer.\r\n\r\n* Gemma3  by @RyanMullins in #36658\r\n\r\n### Shield Gemma2 \r\n\r\nShieldGemma 2 is built on [Gemma 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card_3), is a 4 billion (4B) parameter model that checks the safety of both synthetic and natural images against key categories to help you build robust datasets and models. With this addition to the Gemma family of models, researchers and developers can now easily minimize the risk of harmful content in their models across key areas of harm as defined below:\r\n\r\n-   No Sexually Explicit content: The image shall not contain content that depicts explicit or graphic sexual acts (e.g., pornography, erotic nudity, depictions of rape or sexual assault).\r\n-   No Dangerous Content: The image shall not contain content that facilitates or encourages activities that could cause real-world harm (e.g., building firearms and explosive devices, promotion of terrorism, instructions for suicide).\r\n-   No Violence/Gore content: The image shall not contain content that depicts shocking, sensational, or gratuitous violence (e.g., excessive blood and gore, gratuitous violence against animals, extreme injury or moment of death).\r\n\r\nWe recommend using ShieldGemma 2 as an input filter to vision language models, or as an output filter of image generation systems. To train a robust image safety model, we curated training datasets of natural and synthetic images and instruction-tuned Gemma 3 to demonstrate strong performance.\r\n\r\n* Shieldgemma2 #36678 by @RyanMullins \r\n### Aya Vision\r\n\r\nAyaVision is heavily referenced in the following [model-based release](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.49.0-AyaVision) and we recommend reading these if you want all the information relative to that model.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a90d406-ed2e-435c-931c-07c5eaed9f62)\r\n\r\nThe Aya Vision 8B and 32B models is a state-of-the-art multilingual multimodal models developed by Cohere For AI. They build on the Aya Expanse recipe to handle both visual and textual information without compromising on the strong multilingual textual performance of the original model.\r\n\r\nAya Vision 8B combines the `Siglip2-so400-384-14` vision encoder with the Cohere CommandR-7B language model further post-trained with the Aya Expanse recipe, creating a powerful vision-language model capable of understanding images and generating text across 23 languages. Whereas, Aya Vision 32B uses Aya Expanse 32B as the language model.\r\n\r\nKey features of Aya Vision include:\r\n- Multimodal capabilities in 23 languages\r\n- Strong text-only multilingual capabilities inherited from CommandR-7B post-trained with the Aya Expanse recipe and Aya Expanse 32B\r\n- High-quality visual understanding using the Siglip2-so400-384-14 vision encoder\r\n- Seamless integration of visual and textual information in 23 languages.\r\n\r\n* Add aya  by @ArthurZucker in #36521\r\n\r\n### Mistral 3.1\r\n\r\nMistral 3.1 is heavily referenced in the following [model-based release](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.49.0-Mistral-3) and we recommend reading these if you want all the information relative to that model.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f3ae3f3-87e8-4a64-a72e-6167ff6d90e5)\r\n\r\nBuilding upon Mistral Small 3 (2501), Mistral Small 3.1 (2503) adds state-of-the-art vision understanding and enhances long context capabilities up to 128k tokens without compromising text performance. With 24 billion parameters, this model achieves top-tier capabilities in both text and vision tasks.\r\n\r\nIt is ideal for:\r\n- Fast-response conversational agents.\r\n- Low-latency function calling.\r\n- Subject matter experts via fine-tuning.\r\n- Local inference for hobbyists and organizations handling sensitive data.\r\n- Programming and math reasoning.\r\n- Long document understanding.\r\n- Visual understanding.\r\n\r\n* Add Mistral3  by @Cyrilvallez in #36790\r\n\r\n### Smol VLM 2\r\n\r\nSmolVLM-2 is heavily referenced in the following [model-based release](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.49.0-SmolVLM-2) and we recommend reading these if you want all the information relative to that model.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbdac096-f8cd-467a-8bfb-70af4c1e12c8)\r\n\r\nSmolVLM2 is an adaptation of the Idefics3 model with two main differences:\r\n\r\n- It uses SmolLM2 for the text model.\r\n- It supports multi-image and video inputs\r\n\r\n* SmolVLM2  by @orrzohar in #36126\r\n\r\n### SigLIP-2\r\n\r\nSigLIP-2 is heavily referenced in the following [model-based release](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.49.0-SigLIP-2) and we recommend reading these if you want all the information relative to that model.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63122c75-4bfd-469d-8031-da40fc18ed0d)\r\n\r\nThe SigLIP2 model was proposed in [SigLIP 2: Multilingual Vision-Language Encoders with Improved Semantic Understanding, Localization, and Dense Features](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.14786) by Michael Tschannen, Alexey Gritsenko, Xiao Wang, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin,\r\nNikhil Parthasarathy, Talfan Evans, Lucas Beyer, Ye Xia, Basil Mustafa, Olivier H\u00e9naff, Jeremiah Harmsen,\r\nAndreas Steiner and Xiaohua Zhai.\r\n\r\nThe model comes in two variants\r\n\r\n 1) FixRes - model works with fixed resolution images (backward compatible with SigLIP v1)\r\n 2) NaFlex - model works with variable image aspect ratios and resolutions (SigLIP2 in `transformers`)\r\n\r\n* Add SigLIP 2  by @qubvel in #36323\r\n\r\n### Prompt Depth Anything\r\n\r\nPromptDepthAnything is a high-resolution, accurate metric depth estimation model that leverages prompting, inspired by its success in vision-language (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). Using iPhone LiDAR as a prompt, the model generates precise depth maps at up to 4K resolution, unlocking the potential of depth foundation models.\r\n\r\n![image](https://promptda.github.io/assets/teaser.jpg)\r\n\r\n* Add Prompt Depth Anything Model by @haotongl in #35401\r\n\r\n## New tool: attention visualization\r\n\r\nWe add a new tool to `transformers` to visualize the attention layout of a given model. It only requires a model ID as input, and will load the relevant tokenizer/model and display what the attention mask looks like. Some examples:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n\r\nfrom transformers.utils.attention_visualizer import AttentionMaskVisualizer\r\nvisualizer = AttentionMaskVisualizer(\"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct\")\r\nvisualizer(\"A normal attention mask\")\r\n\r\nvisualizer = AttentionMaskVisualizer(\"mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501\")\r\nvisualizer(\"A normal attention mask with a long text to see how it is displayed, and if it is displayed correctly\")\r\n\r\nvisualizer = AttentionMaskVisualizer(\"google/paligemma2-3b-mix-224\")\r\nvisualizer(\"<img> You are an assistant.\", suffix = \"What is on the image?\")\r\n\r\nvisualizer = AttentionMaskVisualizer(\"google/gemma-2b\")\r\nvisualizer(\"You are an assistant. Make sure you print me\") # we should have slidiing on non sliding side by side\r\n\r\nvisualizer = AttentionMaskVisualizer(\"google/gemma-3-27b-it\")\r\nvisualizer(\"<img>You are an assistant. Make sure you print me\") # we should have slidiing on non sliding side by side\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a926a20-b084-4420-8bda-5a43cd30ef2f)\r\n\r\n* Add attention visualization tool by @ArthurZucker in #36630\r\n\r\n## Deprecating transformers.agents in favor of smolagents\r\n\r\nWe are deprecating `transformers.agents` in favour of the `smolagents` library. Read more about smolagents [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/index).\r\n\r\n* Deprecate transformers.agents  by @aymeric-roucher in #36415\r\n\r\n# Quantization\r\n\r\nWe support adding custom quantization method by using the `@register_quantization_config` and `@register_quantizer` decorator:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@register_quantization_config(\"custom\")\r\nclass CustomConfig(QuantizationConfigMixin):\r\n   pass\r\n\r\n@register_quantizer(\"custom\")\r\nclass CustomQuantizer(HfQuantizer):\r\n   pass\r\n\r\nquantized_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"facebook/opt-350m\", quantization_config=CustomConfig(), torch_dtype=\"auto\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Added Support for Custom Quantization  by @keetrap in #35915\r\n* Add Example for Custom quantization  by @MekkCyber in #36286\r\n\r\nAMD is developing its in-house quantizer named [Quark](https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/) released under MIT license, which supports a broad range of quantization pre-processing, algorithms, dtypes and target hardware. You can now load a model quantized by quark library: \r\n\r\n```python \r\n# pip install amd-quark\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"EmbeddedLLM/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-w_fp8_per_channel_sym\"\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = model.to(\"cuda\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Support loading Quark quantized models in Transformers by @fxmarty-amd and @BowenBao in #36372 \r\n\r\nTorchao is augmented with `autoquant` support, CPU-quantization, as well as new `AOBaseConfig` object instances for more advanced configuration. \r\n\r\n* Add autoquant support for torchao quantizer  by @jerryzh168 in #35503\r\n* enable torchao quantization on CPU  by @jiqing-feng in #36146\r\n* Add option for ao base configs by @drisspg in #36526 \r\n\r\n## Tensor Parallelism implementation changes\r\n\r\nAt loading time, the parallelization is now applied module-by-module, so that no memory overhead is required compared to what the final weight distribution will be!\r\n\r\n* TP initialization module-by-module  by @Cyrilvallez in #35996\r\n\r\n## Generation\r\n\r\nThis release includes two speed upgrades to `generate`:\r\n1. Assisted generation now works with ANY model as an assistant, even with `do_sample=True`;\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import pipeline\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nprompt = \"Alice and Bob\"\r\ncheckpoint = \"google/gemma-2-9b\"\r\nassistant_checkpoint = \"double7/vicuna-68m\"\r\n\r\npipe = pipeline(\r\n    \"text-generation\",\r\n    model=checkpoint,\r\n    assistant_model=assistant_checkpoint,\r\n    do_sample=True\r\n)\r\npipe_output = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=50, do_sample=True)\r\nprint(pipe_output[0][\"generated_text\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Beam search was vectorized, and should be significantly faster with a large `num_beams`. The speedup is more visible on smaller models, where `model.forward` doesn't dominate the total run time.\r\n\r\n* Universal Speculative Decoding `CandidateGenerator`  by @keyboardAnt, @jmamou, and @gauravjain14 in #35029\r\n* [generate] \u2728 vectorized beam search \u2728  by @gante in #35802\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nA significant redesign of our documentation has wrapped-up. The goal was to greatly simplify the `transformers` documentation, making it much more easy to navigate. Let us know what you think!\r\n\r\n* [docs] Redesign  by @stevhliu in #31757\r\n\r\n## Notable repo maintenance\r\n\r\nThe research examples folder that was hosted in `transformers` is no more. We have moved it out of `transformers` and in the following repo: github.com/huggingface/transformers-research-projects/\r\n\r\n* Remove research projects  by @Rocketknight1 in #36645\r\n\r\nWe have

It is a vision-language model composed by a [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/siglip) vision encoder and a [Gemma 2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gemma_2) language decoder linked by a multimodal linear projection. \r\n\r\nIt cuts an image into a fixed number of tokens same way as Siglip if the image does not exceed certain aspect ratio. For images that exceed the given aspect ratio, it crops the image into multiple smaller pacthes and concatenates them with the base image embedding.\r\n\r\nOne particularity is that the model uses bidirectional attention on all the image tokens. Also, the model interleaves sliding window local attention with full causal attention in the language backbone, where each sixth layer is a full causal attention layer.\r\n\r\n## Usage tips\r\n\r\n\r\n- For image+text and image-only inputs use `Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration`.\r\n- For text-only inputs use `Gemma3ForCausalLM` for generation to avoid loading the vision tower.\r\n- Each sample can contain multiple images, and the number of images can vary between samples. However make sure to pass correctly batched images to the processor, where each batch is a list of one or more images.\r\n- The text passed to the processor should have the `\"<start_of_image_>\"` token where the images should be inserted.\r\n- The processor has its own `apply_chat_template` method to convert chat messages to text that can then be passed as text to the processor. You can also get a vectorized output from `apply_chat_template`. See the examples below for more details on how to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Image cropping for high resolution images\r\n\r\nThe model supports cropping images into smaller patches when the image aspect ratio exceeds a certain value. By default the images are not cropped and only the base image is forwarded to the model. Users can set `do_pan_and_scan=True` to obtain several crops per image along with the base image to improve the quality in DocVQA or similar tasks requiring higher resolution images.\r\n\r\nPan and scan is an inference time optimization to handle images with skewed aspect ratios. When enabled, it improves performance on tasks related to document understanding, infographics, OCR, etc.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor\r\n\r\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/gemma-3-4b-it\", padding_side=\"left\")\r\n\r\nurl = \"https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1192867753/photo/cow-in-berchida-beach-siniscola.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=v0hjjniwsMNfJSuKWZuIn8pssmD5h5bSN1peBd1CmH4=\"\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"system\",\r\n        \"content\": [\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\r\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"url\": url},\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is shown in this image?\"},\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n]\r\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    tokenize=True,\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n    do_pan_and_scan=True,\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Example\r\n\r\n### Single-image Inference\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"google/gemma-3-4b-it\"\r\nmodel = Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\")\r\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, padding_side=\"left\")\r\n\r\nurl = \"https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1192867753/photo/cow-in-berchida-beach-siniscola.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=v0hjjniwsMNfJSuKWZuIn8pssmD5h5bSN1peBd1CmH4=\"\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"system\",\r\n        \"content\": [\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\r\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"url\": url},\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is shown in this image?\"},\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n]\r\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    tokenize=True,\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n\r\noutput = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)\r\nprint(processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)[inputs.input_ids.shape[1]: ])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Multi-image Inference\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, Gemma3ForCausalLM\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"google/gemma-3-4b-it\"\r\nmodel = Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\")\r\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, padding_side=\"left\")\r\n\r\nurl_cow = \"https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1192867753/photo/cow-in-berchida-beach-siniscola.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=v0hjjniwsMNfJSuKWZuIn8pssmD5h5bSN1peBd1CmH4=\"\r\nurl_stop = \"https://www.ilankelman.org/stopsigns/australia.jpg\"\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"system\",\r\n        \"content\": [\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\r\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"url\": url_cow},\r\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"url\": url_stop},\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Are these two images identical?\"},\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n]\r\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages,\r\n    tokenize=True,\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n\r\noutput = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)\r\nprint(processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)[inputs.input_ids.shape[1]: ])\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Text-only inference\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, Gemma3ForCausalLM\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"google/gemma-3-1b-it\"\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = Gemma3ForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map=\"auto\")\r\n\r\ninput_ids = tokenizer(\"Write me a poem about Machine Learning.\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\r\n\r\noutputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=100)\r\ntext = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)\r\n\r\nprint(text)\r\n\r\n```",

They build on the Aya Expanse recipe to handle both visual and textual information without compromising on the strong multilingual textual performance of the original model.\r\n\r\nAya Vision 8B combines the `Siglip2-so400-384-14` vision encoder with the Cohere CommandR-7B language model further post-trained with the Aya Expanse recipe, creating a powerful vision-language model capable of understanding images and generating text across 23 languages. Whereas, Aya Vision 32B uses Aya Expanse 32B as the language model.\r\n\r\nKey features of Aya Vision include:\r\n- Multimodal capabilities in 23 languages\r\n- Strong text-only multilingual capabilities inherited from CommandR-7B post-trained with the Aya Expanse recipe and Aya Expanse 32B\r\n- High-quality visual understanding using the Siglip2-so400-384-14 vision encoder\r\n- Seamless integration of visual and textual information in 23 languages.\r\n\r\n## Usage Example\r\n\r\nHere's an example usage of the Aya Vision model.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nmodel_id = \"CohereForAI/aya-vision-32b\"\r\n\r\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(\r\n    model_id, device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.float16\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Format message with the aya-vision chat template\r\nmessages = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\",\r\n     \"content\": [\r\n       {\"type\": \"image\", \"url\": \"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fx7YvfQWYAIp6rZ?format=jpg&name=medium\"},\r\n        {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u093f\u0916\u093e \u092a\u093e\u0920 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u0939\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948?\"},\r\n    ]},\r\n    ]\r\n\r\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\r\n    messages, padding=True, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors=\"pt\"\r\n).to(model.device)\r\n\r\ngen_tokens = model.generate(\r\n    **inputs, \r\n    max_new_tokens=300, \r\n    do_sample=True, \r\n    temperature=0.3,\r\n)\r\n\r\nprint(processor.tokenizer.decode(gen_tokens[0][inputs.input_ids.shape[1]:], skip_special_tokens=True))\r\n```",

In this second iteration, we extend the original image-text training objective with\r\nseveral prior, independently developed techniques into a unified recipe\u2014this includes decoder-based\r\npretraining, self-supervised losses (self-distillation, masked prediction) and online data curation. With\r\nthese changes, SigLIP 2 models outperform their SigLIP counterparts at all model scales in core capabilities, \r\nincluding zero-shot classification (best SigLIP 2 ViT-g/16 achieves 85.0% ImageNet zero-shot\r\naccuracy), image-text retrieval, and transfer performance when extracting visual representations for\r\nVision-Language Models (VLMs). Furthermore, the new training recipe leads to significant improvements \r\non localization and dense prediction tasks. We also train variants which support multiple resolutions \r\nand preserve the input\u2019s native aspect ratio. Finally, we train on a more diverse data-mixture that\r\nincludes de-biasing techniques, leading to much better multilingual understanding and improved fair-\r\nness. To provide users with the ability to trade-off inference cost with performance, we release model\r\ncheckpoints at four sizes (ViT-B/86M, L/303M, So400m/400M, and g/1B).*\r\n\r\n## Usage tips\r\n\r\n- Usage of SigLIP2 is similar to [SigLIP](siglip) and [CLIP](clip). The main difference from CLIP is the training loss, which does not require a global view of all the pairwise similarities of images and texts within a batch. One needs to apply the sigmoid activation function to the logits, rather than the softmax.\r\n- Training is supported but does not use `torch.distributed` utilities which may limit the scalability of batch size. However, DDP and FDSP works on single-node multi-gpu setup.\r\n- When using the standalone [`GemmaTokenizerFast`] make sure to pass `padding=\"max_length\"` and `max_length=64` as that's how the model was trained.\r\n- Model was trained with *lowercased* text, make sure you make the same preprocessing for your text labels.\r\n- To get the same results as the pipeline, a prompt template of \"this is a photo of {label}\" should be used.\r\n- The NaFlex variant supports processing images at higher resolutions by adjusting the `max_num_patches` parameter in the `Processor`. The default value is `max_num_patches=256`. Increasing `max_num_patches` to 1024 (4x) will approximately double processed image height and width, while preserving the aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/siglip2_metrics_table.png\"\r\nalt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\r\n\r\nThis model was contributed by [qubvel](https://huggingface.co/qubvel-hf).\r\nThe original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/tree/main).\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\nThere are 2 main ways to use SigLIP2: either using the pipeline API, which abstracts away all the complexity for you, or by using the `Siglip2Model` class yourself.\r\n\r\n### FixRes variant\r\n\r\n**Pipeline API**\r\n\r\nThe pipeline allows to use the model in a few lines of code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\r\n>>> from PIL import Image\r\n>>> import requests\r\n\r\n>>> # load pipe\r\n>>> image_classifier = pipeline(\r\n...     task=\"zero-shot-image-classification\",\r\n...     model=\"google/siglip2-base-patch16-224\",\r\n... )\r\n\r\n>>> # load image\r\n>>> url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\r\n>>> image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\r\n\r\n>>> # inference\r\n>>> candidate_labels = [\"2 cats\", \"a plane\", \"a remote\"]\r\n>>> outputs = image_classifier(image, candidate_labels=candidate_labels)\r\n>>> outputs = [{\"score\": round(output[\"score\"], 4), \"label\": output[\"label\"] } for output in outputs]\r\n>>> print(outputs)\r\n[{'score': 0.1499, 'label': '2 cats'}, {'score': 0.0008, 'label': 'a remote'}, {'score': 0.0, 'label': 'a plane'}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Using the model yourself**\r\n\r\nIf you want to do the pre- and postprocessing yourself, here's how to do that:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from PIL import Image\r\n>>> import requests\r\n>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModel\r\n>>> import torch\r\n\r\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"google/siglip2-base-patch16-224\")\r\n>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/siglip2-base-patch16-224\")\r\n\r\n>>> url = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\r\n>>> image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\r\n\r\n>>> candidate_labels = [\"2 cats\", \"2 dogs\"]\r\n# follows the pipeline prompt template to get same results\r\n>>> texts = [f\"This is a photo of {label}.\" for label in candidate_labels]\r\n\r\n# IMPORTANT: we pass `padding=max_length` and `max_length=64` since the model was trained with this\r\n>>> inputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, padding=\"max_length\", max_length=64, return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\n\r\n>>> with torch.no_grad():\r\n...     outputs = model(**inputs)\r\n\r\n>>> logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image\r\n>>> probs = torch.sigmoid(logits_per_image) # these are the probabilities\r\n>>> print(f\"{probs[0][0]:.1%} that image 0 is '{candidate_labels[0]}'\")\r\n15.0% that image 0 is '2 cats'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### NaFlex variant\r\n\r\nNaFlex combines ideas from FlexiViT, i.e. supporting multiple, predefined sequence lengths \r\nwith a single ViT model, and NaViT, namely processing images at their native aspect ratio.\r\nThis enables processing different types of images at appropriate resolution, e.g. using a\r\nlarger resolution to process document images, while at the same time minimizing the impact \r\nof aspect ratio distortion on certain inference tasks, e.g. on OCR.\r\n\r\nGiven a patch size and target sequence length, NaFlex preprocesses the data by first resizing \r\nthe input image such that the height and width after resizing are multiples of the patch size,\r\nwhile \r\n    \r\n    1. keeping the aspect ratio distortion as small as possible\r\n    2. producing a sequence length of at most the desired target sequence length (`max_num_patches`)\r\n    \r\nThe resulting distortion in width and height is at most `(patch_size - 1) / width` and\r\n`(patch_size - 1) / height`, respectively, which tends to be small for common resolutions and aspect ratios. \r\nAfter resizing, the image is split into a sequence of patches, and a mask with padding information is added.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from PIL import Image\r\n>>> import requests\r\n>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModel\r\n>>> import torch\r\n\r\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"google/siglip2-base-patch16-naflex\")\r\n>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"google/siglip2-base-patch16-naflex\")\r\n\r\n>>> url = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\r\n>>> image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\r\n\r\n>>> candidate_labels = [\"2 cats\", \"2 dogs\"]\r\n# follows the pipeline prompt template to get same results\r\n>>> texts = [f\"This is a photo of {label}.\" for label in candidate_labels]\r\n\r\n# default value for `max_num_patches` is 256, but you can increase resulted image resolution providing\r\n# higher values e.g. `max_num_patches=512`\r\n>>> inputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, max_num_patches=256, return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\n\r\n>>> with torch.no_grad():\r\n...     outputs = model(**inputs)\r\n\r\n>>> logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image\r\n>>> probs = torch.sigmoid(logits_per_image) # these are the probabilities\r\n>>> print(f\"{probs[0][0]:.1%} that image 0 is '{candidate_labels[0]}'\")\r\n21.1% that image 0 is '2 cats'\r\n```",

The resizing behavior depends on two parameters: do_resize and size.\r\n\r\nVideos should not be upsampled. \r\n\r\nIf `do_resize` is set to `True`, the model resizes images so that the longest edge is 4*512 pixels by default.\r\nThe default resizing behavior can be customized by passing a dictionary to the `size` parameter. For example, `{\"longest_edge\": 4 * 512}` is the default, but you can change it to a different value if needed.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s how to control resizing and set a custom size:\r\n```python\r\nimage_processor = SmolVLMImageProcessor(do_resize=True, size={\"longest_edge\": 2 * 512}, max_image_size=512)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `max_image_size` parameter, which controls the size of each square patch the image is decomposed into, is set to 512 by default but can be adjusted as needed. After resizing (if applicable), the image processor decomposes the images into square patches based on the `max_image_size` parameter.\r\n\r\nThis model was contributed by [orrzohar](https://huggingface.co/orrzohar).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage example\r\n\r\n### Single Media inference\r\n\r\nThe model can accept both images and videos as input, but you should use only one of the modalities at a time. Here's an example code for that.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForImageTextToText\r\n\r\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM2-256M-Video-Instruct\")\r\nmodel = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM2-256M-Video-Instruct\",\r\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,\r\n    device_map=\"cuda\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nconversation = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"user\",\r\n        \"content\":[\r\n            {\"type\": \"image\", \"url\": \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"},\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this image.\"}\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n\r\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\r\n    conversation,\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n    tokenize=True,\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n).to(model.device, dtype=torch.bfloat16)\r\n\r\noutput_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)\r\ngenerated_texts = processor.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\r\nprint(generated_texts)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Video\r\nconversation = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"role\": \"user\",\r\n        \"content\": [\r\n            {\"type\": \"video\", \"path\": \"/path/to/video.mp4\"},\r\n            {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Describe this video in detail\"}\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n\r\ninputs = processor.apply_chat_template(\r\n    conversation,\r\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\r\n    tokenize=True,\r\n    return_dict=True,\r\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\r\n).to(model.device, dtype=torch.bfloat16)\r\n\r\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=100)\r\ngenerated_texts = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\r\nprint(generated_texts[0])\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "# New models\r\n\r\n## Helium\r\n\r\nHelium-1 preview is a lightweight language model with 2B parameters, targeting edge and mobile devices. It supports the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"860\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52e91b74-5572-46a6-93e5-058730411675\" />\r\n\r\n* Add-helium  by @ArthurZucker in #35669\r\n\r\n\r\n## Qwen2.5-VL\r\n\r\nThe [Qwen2.5-VL](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2_5-vl/) model is an update to [Qwen2-VL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12191) from Qwen team, Alibaba Group.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from this update is the following:\r\n\r\nQwen2.5-VL marks a major step forward from Qwen2-VL, built upon the latest Qwen2.5 LLM. We\u2019ve accelerated training and testing through the strategic implementation of window attention within the ViT. The ViT architecture itself has been refined with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it more closely with the LLM\u2019s structure. A key innovation is the expansion of native dynamic resolution to encompass the temporal dimension, in addition to spatial aspects. Furthermore, we\u2019ve upgraded MRoPE, incorporating absolute time alignment on the time axis to allow the model to effectively capture temporal dynamics, regardless of frame rate, leading to superior video understanding.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a5c25ae-5c1a-4137-8cfa-340962777481)\r\n\r\n* add qwen2.5vl  by @ShuaiBai623 in #35569\r\n\r\n## SuperGlue\r\n\r\nThe SuperGlue model was proposed in [SuperGlue: Learning Feature Matching with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11763) by Paul-Edouard Sarlin, Daniel DeTone, Tomasz Malisiewicz and Andrew Rabinovich.\r\n\r\nThis model consists of matching two sets of interest points detected in an image. Paired with the [SuperPoint model](https://huggingface.co/magic-leap-community/superpoint), it can be used to match two images and estimate the pose between them. This model is useful for tasks such as image matching, homography estimation, etc.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"424\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d81983f-f9ce-4d82-adb7-e76098df543a\" />\r\n\r\n* Add SuperGlue model  by @sbucaille in #29886\r\n\r\n## Granite Vision Support\r\n\r\nThe Granite Vision model is a variant of [LLaVA-NeXT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/llava_next), leveraging a [Granite](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/granite) language model alongside a [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/SigLIP) visual encoder. It utilizes multiple concatenated vision hidden states as its image features, similar to [VipLlava](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/vipllava). It also uses a larger set of image grid pinpoints than the original LlaVa-NeXT models to support additional aspect ratios.\r\n\r\n* Granite Vision Support  by @alex-jw-brooks in #35579\r\n\r\n## Zamba2\r\n\r\nZamba2 is a large language model (LLM) trained by Zyphra, and made available under an Apache 2.0 license. \r\n\r\nZamba2-1.2B, Zamba2-2.7B and Zamba2-7B are hybrid models combining state-space models (Specifically [Mamba](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba)) and transformer, and were trained using next-token prediction. Zamba2 uses shared transformer layers after every 6 mamba blocks. It uses the [Mistral v0.1 tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1). We came to this architecture after a series of ablations at small scales. Zamba2-1.2B, Zamba2-2.7B and Zamba2-7B were pre-trained on 2T and 3T tokens, respectively.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96202534-b8ac-4adc-b355-34b14554660f)\r\n\r\n* Add Zamba2  by @pglorio in #34517\r\n\r\n## GOT-OCR 2.0\r\n\r\nGOT-OCR2 works on a wide range of tasks, including plain document OCR, scene text OCR, formatted document OCR, and even OCR for tables, charts, mathematical formulas, geometric shapes, molecular formulas and sheet music. While this implementation of the model will only output plain text, the outputs can be further processed to render the desired format, with packages like pdftex, mathpix, matplotlib, tikz, verovio or pyecharts. The model can also be used for interactive OCR, where the user can specify the region to be recognized by providing the coordinates or the color of the region\u2019s bounding box.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7373535-6fd4-4625-930b-163965660cca)\r\n\r\n* Add GOT-OCR 2.0 to Transformers  by @yonigozlan in #34721\r\n\r\n## DAB-DETR\r\n\r\nDAB-DETR is an enhanced variant of Conditional DETR. It utilizes dynamically updated anchor boxes to provide both a reference query point (x, y) and a reference anchor size (w, h), improving cross-attention computation. This new approach achieves 45.7% AP when trained for 50 epochs with a single ResNet-50 model as the backbone.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9e5eefd-c05b-448b-b6c4-7527d6626d96)\r\n\r\n* Add DAB-DETR for object detection  by @conditionedstimulus in #30803\r\n\r\n## Depth PRO\r\n\r\nDepthPro is a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation, designed to generate high-resolution depth maps with remarkable sharpness and fine-grained details. It employs a multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture, where images are downsampled, divided into patches, and processed using a shared Dinov2 encoder. The extracted patch-level features are merged, upsampled, and refined using a DPT-like fusion stage, enabling precise depth estimation.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro/blob/main/data/depth-pro-teaser.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n* Add Apple's Depth-Pro for depth estimation  by @geetu040 in #34583\r\n\r\n## RT-DETRv2\r\n\r\nAn improved **Real-Time** DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR). RT-DETRv2 refines RT-DETR by introducing selective multi-scale feature extraction, a discrete sampling operator for broader deployment compatibility. These improvements yield a 0.3 to 1.4 increase in mAP metrics on the COCO dataset, all while maintaining the same parameter count and frames-per-second (FPS) performance.\r\n\r\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/rt_detr_architecture.png)\r\n\r\n* Adding RTDETRv2  by @jadechoghari in #34773 \r\n\r\n## Transformers-CLI\r\n\r\nTransformers' CLI welcomes a new command: `chat`. This command starts a conversation with the model of your choosing directly in your terminal.\r\n\r\nThis feature exists in TRL and has been migrated to `transformers` for easier usage.\r\n\r\n![ezgif-56c494108b6d77](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8157553-0681-4abb-be26-7f37692b1c93)\r\n\r\n* [Chat] Add Chat from TRL \ud83d\udc08   by @gante in #35714\r\n\r\n## Processor Standardization\r\n\r\nAn ongoing work is to standardize the image processors so that their API is equivalent. Additionally, the processors are given a fast variant so that they are never blockers in the image processing pipelines.\r\n\r\nIn this release, several processors have been standardized and have seen their fast version be contributed.\r\n\r\n* OwlViT/Owlv2 post processing standardization  by @qubvel in #34929\r\n* OmDet Turbo processor standardization  by @qubvel in #34937\r\n* Grounding DINO Processor standardization  by @qubvel in #34853\r\n* Refactoring of ImageProcessorFast  by @yonigozlan in #35069\r\n* add Qwen2-VL image processor fast  by @yonigozlan in #35733\r\n* Remove Multi-threaded image conversion for fast image processors  by @yonigozlan in #36105\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### DPT segmentation maps\r\n\r\nDPT image processors did not support `segmentation_maps`, instead only requiring `images`. This has been fixed.\r\nThis adds an argument to the `preprocess` method, therefore users using arguments as positional arguments with that method may see changed behavior. We recommend using keyword arguments for such methods so as to not be bothered by the addition of new features.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd34 \ud83d\udd34 \ud83d\udd34  Added `segmentation maps` support for DPT image processor  by @simonreise in #34345\r\n\r\n### Image classification pipeline and single vs multi-label\r\n\r\nThe `problem_type` in the config.json file was read incorrectly by the pipeline, which mapped single-label to multi-label losses, and vice-versa. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 image-classification pipeline single-label and multi-label prob type squashing fns (sigmoid vs softmax) are backwards  by @rwightman in #35848\r\n\r\n### Fixing the LayerNorm beta/gamma renames\r\n\r\nThe description of the pull request is the easiest way to understand the problem, why it exists, and how it is solved; please read the description below:\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 An attempt to fix #29554. Include 'LayerNorm.' in gamma/beta rename scope, optimize string search.  by @rwightman in #35615\r\n\r\n### VLM cleanup\r\n\r\nThe `ignore_index` property of the llava configuration has been removed as it was not serving a purpose.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udd34 VLM: compile compatibility  by @zucchini-nlp in #35724\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\nQuantization has received several improvements and fixes, including the contribution of FP8 quantization and the HIGGS quantization interface.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we're replacing the AutoGPTQ implementaiton with GPTQModel from ModelCloud (see repository [here)](https://github.com/ModelCloud/GPTQModel?tab=readme-ov-file)).\r\n\r\nGPTQModel originated as major refractor of AutoGPTQ but is now a full-stand-in replacement with cleaner api, up-to-date

    "body": "## New models\r\n\r\n### ModernBERT\r\n\r\nThe ModernBert model was proposed in [Smarter, Better, Faster, Longer: A Modern Bidirectional Encoder for Fast, Memory Efficient, and Long Context Finetuning and Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13663) by Benjamin Warner, Antoine Chaffin, Benjamin Clavi\u00e9, Orion Weller, Oskar Hallstr\u00f6m, Said Taghadouini, Alexis Galalgher, Raja Bisas, Faisal Ladhak, Tom Aarsen, Nathan Cooper, Grifin Adams, Jeremy Howard and Iacopo Poli.\r\n\r\nIt is a refresh of the traditional encoder architecture, as used in previous models such as [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert) and [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/roberta).\r\n\r\nIt builds on BERT and implements many modern architectural improvements which have been developed since its original release, such as:\r\n\r\n- [Rotary Positional Embeddings](https://huggingface.co/blog/designing-positional-encoding) to support sequences of up to 8192 tokens.\r\n- [Unpadding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08124) to ensure no compute is wasted on padding tokens, speeding up processing time for batches with mixed-length sequences.\r\n- [GeGLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202) Replacing the original MLP layers with GeGLU layers, shown to improve performance.\r\n-  [Alternating Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150v2) where most attention layers employ a sliding window of 128 tokens, with Global Attention only used every 3 layers.\r\n- [Flash Attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) to speed up processing.\r\n- A model designed following recent [The Case for Co-Designing Model Architectures with Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14489), ensuring maximum efficiency across inference GPUs.\r\n- Modern training data scales (2 trillion tokens) and mixtures (including code ande math data)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4256c0b1-9b40-4d71-ac42-fc94827d5e9d)\r\n\r\n* Add ModernBERT to Transformers  by @warner-benjamin in #35158\r\n\r\n### Aria\r\n\r\nThe Aria model was proposed in [Aria: An Open Multimodal Native Mixture-of-Experts Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.05993) by Li et al. from the Rhymes.AI team.\r\n\r\nAria is an open multimodal-native model with best-in-class performance across a wide range of multimodal, language, and coding tasks. It has a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, with respectively 3.9B and 3.5B activated parameters per visual token and text token.\r\n\r\n* Add Aria  by @aymeric-roucher in #34157\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef41fcc9-2c5f-4a75-ab1a-438f73d3d7e2)\r\n\r\n### TimmWrapper\r\n\r\nWe add a `TimmWrapper` set of classes such that timm models can be loaded in as transformer models into the library.\r\n\r\nHere's a general usage example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nfrom transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForImageClassification, AutoImageProcessor\r\n\r\ncheckpoint = \"timm/resnet50.a1_in1k\"\r\nimg = Image.open(urlopen(\r\n    'https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/beignets-task-guide.png'\r\n))\r\n\r\nimage_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\r\ninputs = image_processor(img, return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nmodel = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\r\n\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    logits = model(**inputs).logits\r\n\r\ntop5_probabilities, top5_class_indices = torch.topk(logits.softmax(dim=1) * 100, k=5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to this, timm models now have access to pipelines, as well as `Trainer`, accelerate device maps, quantization, etc: \r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\n\r\nfrom transformers import pipeline\r\n\r\nimg = Image.open(urlopen(\r\n    'https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/beignets-task-guide.png'\r\n))\r\npipe = pipeline(\"image-classification\", model=\"timm/resnet18.a1_in1k\")\r\nprint(pipe(img))\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Add TimmWrapper  by @qubvel and @amyeroberts in #34564\r\n\r\n### Pixtral-Large\r\n\r\nPixtral modeling and checkpoint conversion code has been updated to support the new [Pixtral-Large](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Pixtral-Large-Instruct-2411) model.\r\n\r\n* Update Pixtral conversion script to support large format! by @arthurzucker in #34801\r\n\r\n### ColPali\r\n\r\nThe ColPali model was proposed in [ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.01449) by Manuel Faysse*, Hugues Sibille*, Tony Wu*, Bilel Omrani, Gautier Viaud, C\u00e9line Hudelot, Pierre Colombo (* denotes equal contribution). Work lead by ILLUIN Technology.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed ColPali approach, the authors leverage VLMs to construct efficient multi-vector embeddings directly from document images (\u201cscreenshots\u201d) for document retrieval. They train the model to maximize the similarity between these document embeddings and the corresponding query embeddings, using the late interaction method introduced in ColBERT.\r\n\r\n![colpali_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545ed1d7-ea82-4d0d-80c1-4fcbb1c828cd)\r\n\r\n* Add ColPali to \ud83e\udd17 transformers  by @tonywu71 and @yonigozlan in #33736\r\n\r\n### Falcon3\r\n\r\nFalcon3 represents a natural evolution from previous releases, emphasizing expanding the models\u2019 science, math, and code capabilities. This iteration includes five base models: Falcon3-1B-Base, Falcon3-3B-Base, Falcon3-Mamba-7B-Base, Falcon3-7B-Base, and Falcon3-10B-Base. In developing these models, the authors incorporated several key innovations aimed at improving the models\u2019 performances while reducing training costs:\r\n\r\nOne pre-training: They conducted a single large-scale pretraining run on the 7B model, using 2048 H100 GPU chips, leveraging 14 trillion tokens featuring web, code, STEM, and curated high-quality and multilingual data. Depth up-scaling for improved reasoning: Building on recent studies on the effects of model depth, they upscaled the 7B model to a 10B parameters model by duplicating the redundant layers and continuing pre-training with 2TT of high-quality data. This yielded Falcon3-10B-Base which achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance for models under 13B parameters. Knowledge distillation for better tiny models: To provide compact and efficient alternatives, we developed Falcon3-1B-Base and Falcon3-3B-Base by leveraging pruning and knowledge distillation techniques, using less than 100GT of curated high-quality data, thereby redefining pre-training efficiency.\r\n\r\n* Add Falcon3 documentation  by @mokeddembillel in #35307\r\n\r\n### Bamba\r\n\r\nBamba-9B is a decoder-only language model based on the [Mamba-2](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba) architecture and is designed to handle a wide range of text generation tasks. It is trained from scratch using a two-stage training approach. In the first stage, the model is trained on 2 trillion tokens from the Dolma v1.7 dataset. In the second stage, it undergoes additional training on 200 billion tokens, leveraging a carefully curated blend of high-quality data to further refine its performance and enhance output quality.\r\n\r\nCheckout all Bamba-9B model checkpoints [here](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/bamba).\r\n\r\n* Add the Bamba Model  by @fabianlim in #34982\r\n\r\n### VitPose\r\n\r\nViTPose is a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based model for human pose estimation, introduced by Yufei Xu, Jing Zhang, Qiming Zhang, and Dacheng Tao in [\"ViTPose: Simple Vision Transformer Baselines for Human Pose Estimation\u201d](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12484). \r\n\r\nThe model leverages the capabilities of vision transformers to accurately predict 2D human keypoints. Adopting a top-down approach, ViTPose estimates keypoints locations for each detected person, allowing it to be easily used with any object detection model.\r\n\r\n![vitpose](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/vitpose-architecture.png)\r\n\r\n* Add VitPose  by @SangbumChoi and @NielsRogge in #30530 \r\n\r\n### DINOv2 with registers\r\n\r\nThe DINOv2 with Registers model was proposed in [Vision Transformers Need Registers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588) by Timoth\u00e9e Darcet, Maxime Oquab, Julien Mairal, Piotr Bojanowski.\r\n\r\nThe [Vision Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/vit) (ViT) is a transformer encoder model (BERT-like) originally introduced to do supervised image classification on ImageNet.\r\n\r\nNext, people figured out ways to make ViT work really well on self-supervised image feature extraction (i.e. learning meaningful features, also called embeddings) on images without requiring any labels. Some example papers here include [DINOv2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/dinov2) and [MAE](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/vit_mae).\r\n\r\nThe authors of DINOv2 noticed that ViTs have artifacts in attention maps. It\u2019s due to the model using some image patches as \u201cregisters\u201d. The authors propose a fix: just add some new tokens (called \u201cregister\u201d tokens), which you only use during pre-training (and throw away afterwards). This results in:\r\n\r\n- no artifacts\r\n- interpretable attention maps\r\n- and improved performances.\r\n\r\n* Add DINOv2 with registers  by @NielsRogge in #35348\r\n\r\n### Emu3\r\n\r\nThe Emu3 model was proposed in [Emu3: Next-Token Prediction is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18869) by Xinlong Wang, Xiaosong Zhang, Zhengxiong Luo, Quan Sun, Yufeng Cui, Jinsheng Wang, Fan Zhang, Yueze Wang, Zhen Li, Qiying Yu, Yingli Zhao, Yulong Ao, Xuebin Min, Tao Li, Boya Wu, Bo Zhao, Bowen Zhang, Liangdong Wang, Guang Liu, Zheqi He, Xi Yang, Jingjing Liu, Yonghua Lin, Tiejun Huang, Zhongyuan Wang.\r\n\r\nEmu3 sets a new standard in multimodal AI by using next-token prediction to handle images, text, and videos. It simplifies multimodal modeling by tokenizing all data into a unified format and training a single transformer. Visual data is tokenized using vector quantization methods based on [VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) model. Discretized visual tokens are later fused with text token ids for image and text generation.\r\n\r\nEmu3 outperforms leading models like SDXL and LLaVA-1.6 in both generation and perception tasks, without relying on diffusion or compositional methods..\r\n\r\n* Add Emu3 by @zucchini-nlp in #33770  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Cohere2\r\n\r\nA new Cohere update was added through a new \"Cohere2\" set of classes.\r\n\r\n* Add Cohere2 model  by @alexrs-cohere in #35224\r\n\r\n### TextNet\r\n\r\n[TextNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02394) is a lightweight and efficient architecture designed specifically for text detection, offering superior performance compared to traditional models like MobileNetV3. With variants TextNet-T, TextNet-S, and TextNet-B (6.8M, 8.0M, and 8.9M parameters respectively), it achieves an excellent balance between accuracy and inference speed.\r\n\r\n* Add TextNet  by @jadechoghari in #34979 \r\n\r\n### DiffLlama\r\n\r\n[Differential Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258) combines the Llama architecture with Differential Transformer's Attention. \r\n* Add DiffLllama by @weak-kajuma in #34083\r\n\r\n### PixtralLarge\r\n\r\nThe conversion script needed a few update, while the modeling code was barely changed! \r\n* [PixtralLarge] Update Pixtral conversion script to support large format! (#34801)\r\n\r\n### Moonshine\r\n\r\nMoonshine is an autoregressive speech recognition encoder-decoder model that improves upon Whisper's architecture. Namely, it replaces absolute position embeddings with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). This allows Moonshine to handle audio inputs of any length, unlike Whisper, which is restricted to fixed 30-second windows. It was introduced by Nat Jeffries, Evan King, Manjunath Kudlur, Guy Nicholson, James Wang, and Pete Warden in [Moonshine: Speech Recognition for Live Transcription and Voice Commands\r\n](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15608).\r\n\r\n* Add Moonshine by @eustlb in #34784\r\n\r\n## Quantization methods\r\n\r\n### VPTQ Quantization\r\n\r\nFrom the VPTQ contributors: \r\n\r\n> VPTQ is a novel Post-Training Quantization method that leverages Vector Quantization to high accuracy on LLMs at an extremely low bit-width (<2-bit). VPTQ can compress 70B, even the 405B model, to 1-2 bits without retraining and maintain high accuracy.. More details here: https://github.com/microsoft/vptq\r\n\r\n* FEAT : Adding VPTQ quantization method to HFQuantizer  by @wejoncy in #34770\r\n\r\n### HIGGS Quantization\r\n\r\nFrom the contributors: \r\n\r\n> HIGGS is a new 0-shot quantization algorithm that combines Hadamard preprocessing with MSE-Optimal quantization grids to achieve lower quantization error and SOTA performance. You can find more information in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17525).\r\n> \r\n> Runtime support for HIGGS is implemented through [FLUTE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10960), and its [library](https://github.com/HanGuo97/flute?tab=readme-ov-file).\r\n> \r\n> This PR adds support for HIGGS+FLUTE into transformers allowing for low-error 0-shot quantization and fast LLM inference.\r\n\r\n* HIGGS Quantization Support  by @BlackSamorez in #34997\r\n\r\n## Cleanup\r\n\r\nWe merged a cleanup for vision language models, to make sure it all models are standardized. \r\n* VLMs: major clean up \ud83e\uddfc (#34502)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Conversion scripts\r\n\r\nMany models in Transformers include scripts to convert the original model checkpoints into a Transformers-compatible format. These scripts can be found in the repo using the glob pattern `models/**/convert_*.py`. They were a recurring source of vulnerability reports and CVEs because many models were originally released using insecure formats like older PyTorch `.bin` weights or `pickle` files. The conversion scripts had to open these formats, and this meant that they were vulnerable to maliciously crafted inputs.\r\n\r\nIn practice, we do not see this as a serious vulnerability. The conversion scripts are never imported or called by the rest of the library; each script is standalone, and so the only way to exploit the vulnerability is to create a malicious checkpoint, induce a user to download it, and then also induce them to manually call a specific conversion script on it.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if there is little practical risk of an exploit, we are aware that open vulnerability reports create a compliance problem for users, and so beginning with this release we will be excluding these conversion scripts from release branches and wheels. They will remain accessible to developers on the `main` branch. \r\n \r\n* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Delete conversion scripts when making release wheels  by @Rocketknight1 in #35296\r\n\r\n### Backtracking in Nougat\r\n\r\nA regular expression used within the Nougat code has been modified to ensure it does not hang. The method should output the same results but we cannot guarantee it; we recommend upgrading to the latest transformers if you use this model to ensure your code is performance-optimized.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 Limit backtracking in Nougat regexp  by @qubvel in #35264\r\n\r\n### Whisper decoding\r\n\r\nThis PR finalizes work that aimes to enable short-form (< 30 secs) and long-form generation using temperature fallback. It is a significant improvement to the whisper codebase, but it does result in the following breaking changes:\r\n\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Previously:**  \r\n\u2022 Short-form: Returned a `ModelOutput` or `torch.LongTensor`, including decoder input IDs and the EOS token ID.  \r\n\u2022 Long-form: Returned a `Dict` or `torch.LongTensor`, excluding decoder input IDs and the EOS token ID.\r\n\r\n\u27a1\ufe0f **From now on:**  \r\nShort-form and long-form generation are now treated identically, meaning output differentiation based on these modes is no longer applicable.\r\n\r\nDecoder input IDs and EOS token IDs are never returned, except in two specific cases: when `return_dict_in_generate=True` and (`return_timestamps=False` or `force_unique_generate_call=True`).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the output will be a `ModelOutput`, which is the result of the underlying call to GenerationMixin\u2019s generate. Indeed, `return_timestamps=False` ensures no seeking occurs; only a single call to generate is made. Therefore, this output includes both decoder input IDs and the EOS token ID.\r\n\r\n* [Whisper] \ud83d\udea8 Fix whisper decoding \ud83d\udea8  by @eustlb in #34135\r\n\r\n### Attention refactor\r\n\r\nIn order to have a cleaner, isolated, future-proof code for the attention layers, they have been refactored so as to keep the model attention code within their files; but attention definitions relating to SDPA, Flash Attention, and other types of attention have been moved to a common file.\r\n\r\n* \ud83d\udea8All attention refactor\ud83d\udea8  by @ArthurZucker in #35235\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* Pipeline: simple API for assisted generation by @gante and @Rocketknight1 #34504\r\n* [tokenizers] Ensure that add_prefix_space is propagated to backend_tokenizer.pre_tokenizer (#35593)\r\n* Setup loss_type in config at model init time (#34616)\r\n* [docs] Update Python version in translations  by @jla524 in #35096\r\n* [docs] top_p, top_k, temperature docstrings  by @stevhliu in #35065\r\n* Fix private forked repo.

    "body": "## New models\r\n\r\n\r\n### PaliGemma-2\r\n\r\nPaliGemma 2 and PaliGemma are lightweight open vision-language models (VLM) inspired by [PaLI-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09199), and based on open components like the [SigLIP vision model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343) and the [Gemma language model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08295). PaliGemma takes both images and text as inputs and can answer questions about images with detail and context, meaning that PaliGemma can perform deeper analysis of images and provide useful insights, such as captioning for images and short videos, object detection, and reading text embedded within images.\r\n\r\nPaliGemma 2 is available in 3B, 10B, and 28B parameter sizes, which are based on Gemma 2 2B, 9B, and 27B models, respectively. The original PaliGemma models are available in the 3B size. For more information on Gemma model variants, see the [Gemma models list](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/get_started#models-list). PaliGemma model variants support different pixel resolutions for image inputs, including 224 x 224, 448 x 448, and 896 x 896 pixels.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"743\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55cda8a6-b463-4a58-b7d3-f7d50ee2fa11\">\r\n\r\n### I-JEPA\r\n\r\nThe I-JEPA model was proposed in [Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08243.pdf) by Mahmoud Assran, Quentin Duval, Ishan Misra, Piotr Bojanowski, Pascal Vincent, Michael Rabbat, Yann LeCun, Nicolas Ballas. I-JEPA is a self-supervised learning method that predicts the representations of one part of an image based on other parts of the same image. This approach focuses on learning semantic features without relying on pre-defined invariances from hand-crafted data transformations, which can bias specific tasks, or on filling in pixel-level details, which often leads to less meaningful representations.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"413\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/561ca9d7-0327-477a-96b8-61d2af0caf34\">\r\n\r\n* Add I-JEPA  by @jmtzt in #33125\r\n\r\n### OLMo 2\r\n\r\n<img width=\"833\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1abdde92-0aae-404a-b83e-77ec8bd13b7f\">\r\n\r\nThe OLMo2 model is the successor of the OLMo model, which was proposed in [OLMo: Accelerating the Science of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00838).\r\n\r\nThe architectural changes from the original OLMo model to this model are:\r\n- RMSNorm is used instead of standard layer norm.\r\n- Norm is applied to attention queries and keys.\r\n- Norm is applied after attention/feedforward layers rather than before.\r\n\r\nCommits:\r\n\r\n* Add OLMo November 2024  by @2015aroras in #34551\r\n* Rename OLMo November to OLMo2  by @2015aroras in #34864\r\n\r\n### Layer-Skip Llama\r\n\r\nWe add support for Meta's Layer-Skip Llama 3.2 1B model.\r\n\r\nThe Llama3.2 1B model was continually pretrained with LayerSkip recipe, early exit loss and layer dropout, as presented in [Layer Skip: Enabling Early Exit Inference and Self-Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16710) and is capable of performing self-speculative decoding: decode with earlier layers and verify with remaining layers.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"854\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a9e3596-e44e-419f-804d-9f4d03f8f680\">\r\n\r\n* Self-speculation (Layer-Skip Llama)  by @ArthurZucker in #34240\r\n\r\n## Tensor Parallel implementation\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the `torch.distributed.tensor.parallel` subpackage to implement Tensor Parallel for Llama (as an example).\r\n\r\nThe motivation is multi-fold:\r\n\r\n1. to make modeling code simple as single-worker case:  \r\n    all manual TP implementations under `if self.config.pretraining_tp > 1` can be removed.\r\n    \r\n2. to make tensor parallelism easily accessible by users:  \r\n    added a `model.tensor_parallel(device_mesh)` method that allows users to turn a single-proc model into a parallel model. !- Please guide me to a right place to put this function/method if `PreTrainedModel` is not a preferred place. -!\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR of many to simplify and enable Tensor Parallel across models.\r\n\r\n* Simplify Tensor Parallel implementation with PyTorch TP  by @kwen2501 in #34184\r\n\r\n## Farewell, Python 3.8\r\n\r\nPython 3.8 reaches end of life, and, as such, we drop it from our CI.\r\n\r\n* Drop support for Python 3.8  by @ydshieh in #34314\r\n\r\n## GGUF improvements\r\n\r\nSeveral improvements have been done to the GGUF support in transformers; notably by adding new architectures to the list of supported architectures.\r\n\r\n* Add T5 GGUF loading support  by @junejae in #33389\r\n* Add GGUF for Mamba  by @VladOS95-cyber in #34200\r\n* Add Nemotron GGUF Loading Support  by @farrosalferro in #34725\r\n* Improve gguf tensor processing  by @VladOS95-cyber in #34515\r\n* Fix `use_parallel_residual` and `qkv_bias` for StableLM GGUF config extraction  by @Isotr0py in #34450\r\n\r\n### Fast processors\r\n\r\nWe continue the work to improve the speed of fast processors as detailed in this [roadmap](https://www.notion.so/huggingface2/OptimVision-Optimize-preprocessing-time-10f1384ebcac8091a12debb87fe5f591).\r\n\r\nWe contribute a fast processor to RT-DETR.\r\n\r\n* Add Image Processor Fast RT-DETR  by @yonigozlan in #34354\r\n\r\n### New pipelines\r\n\r\nA new pipeline has been added to transformers: image-text-to-text!\r\n\r\nthe pipeline support the following inputs:\r\n\r\n- unbatched images and text - images=image, text=text\r\n- batched images and text - images = [image, image], text= [text, text]\r\n- several images per prompt (only for models supporting the use of an image token) - images = [[image, image], [image]] or  images=[image, image, image], text = [\"... <image>...<image>...\", \"...<image>...\"]\r\n- Chat templates (for models supporting them).\r\n\r\n* Add image text to text pipeline  by @yonigozlan in #34170\r\n\r\n### Notable refactors\r\n\r\n### Separate chat templates into a single file\r\n\r\nWe have had several issues with chat templates because they're stored as single lines in the JSON config files:\r\n\r\n- Impossible to review diffs\r\n- Very hard to edit in the web UI (or in general)\r\n- Differences between `processor` templates in `chat_template.json` and `tokenizer` templates in `tokenizer_config.json` causing confusion\r\n- Some models use multiple templates, requiring a template dict, but we're trying to discourage that in future and move those models to single templates with conditional behaviour instead\r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\n\r\n- Just move chat templates to a single `chat_template.jinja` file in the repo\r\n- If multiple templates are required, then they should still be stored in the JSON file. This is not supported for `Processor` classes, so processors should always be able to save their template as a raw Jinja file. In general, we'll be gently deprecating multiple templates in future.\r\n- If a `chat_template.jinja` file is present, it overrides the JSON files. If a tokenizer is loaded with both Jinja and JSON chat templates and resaved, it should save only the Jinja file, and not have any `chat_template` entry in `tokenizer_config.json`.\r\n\r\nFor now, we continue saving in the old format by default. I'll probably keep it this way for several versions before making the new format the default, to ensure that most users are able to load the new format before it becomes common. Until then, the new format should mostly be used for testing, to make sure it's ready for deployment when we do the switch.\r\n\r\n* Separate chat templates into a single file  by @Rocketknight1 in #33957\r\n\r\n### Large modular logic refactor\r\n\r\nThis PR largely rework the logic we use in the modular converter. It is (hopefully) clearer and maintainable. Instead of going in all directions, adding stuff, then deleting it if not needed, we now do the following:\r\n\r\n- visit all the modular file (record imports/functions/classes/assignments nodes)\r\n  - create function dependency mapping\r\n- for each import coming from another model:\r\n  - visit the corresponding file\r\n  - create function dependency mapping\r\n  - update mapping with function/assignment from the modular (updated/new functions)\r\n  - create the class dependency graph based on merged dependencies\r\n- update dependency graph of the modular with the functions and assignments imported from the other files\r\n- for each class recorded in the modular:\r\n  - if inherithing from class in another file:\r\n    - replace call to super\r\n    - find the dependencies after the node was replaced\r\n    - follow (updated with modular defs) dependency mapping to add all nodes\r\n  - else:\r\n    - only add needed imported functions (and their dependencies)\r\n- determine the needed imports and add them\r\n\r\n* Large modular logic refactoring  by @Cyrilvallez in #34487\r\n\r\n## Community bugfixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* Remove graph breaks for

    "body": "## New model additions\r\n\r\n### Moshi\r\n\r\nThe Moshi model was proposed in Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue by Alexandre D\u00e9fossez, \r\nLaurent Mazar\u00e9, Manu Orsini, Am\u00e9lie Royer, Patrick P\u00e9rez, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Edouard Grave and Neil Zeghidour.\r\n\r\nMoshi is a speech-text foundation model that casts spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a \r\ntext language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, \r\nwhile modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of \r\nexplicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. Moshi also predicts time-aligned text \r\ntokens as a prefix to audio tokens. This \u201cInner Monologue\u201d method significantly improves the linguistic quality of \r\ngenerated speech and provides streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. As a result, Moshi is the first \r\nreal-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00ed5bcc-47b2-4b73-a8f1-2aa0a2e12b32)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Moshi integration  by @ylacombe in #33624\r\n\r\n### Zamba\r\n\r\nZamba-7B-v1 is a hybrid between state-space models (Specifically Mamba) and transformer, and was trained using \r\nnext-token prediction. Zamba uses a shared transformer layer after every 6 mamba blocks. It uses the Mistral \r\nv0.1 tokenizer. We came to this architecture after a series of ablations at small scales. Zamba-7B-v1 was \r\npre-trained on 1T tokens of text and code data.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"zamba\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a86428b8-4d24-4e5a-bf78-222312693bb2\">\r\n\r\n* Add Zamba  by @pglorio in #30950\r\n\r\n### GLM\r\n\r\nThe GLM Model was proposed in ChatGLM: A Family of Large Language Models from GLM-130B to GLM-4 All Tools by GLM Team,\r\nTHUDM & ZhipuAI.\r\n\r\nThe abstract from the paper starts with the following:\r\n\r\nWe introduce ChatGLM, an evolving family of large language models that we have been developing over time. This \r\nreport primarily focuses on the GLM-4 language series, which includes GLM-4, GLM-4-Air, and GLM-4-9B.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf08b7e-b352-440e-99a0-ddbe90cb7285)\r\n\r\n* add Glm  by @Cyrilvallez in #33823\r\n\r\n### Idefics 3\r\n\r\nThe Idefics3 model was proposed in Building and better understanding vision-language models: insights and future directions by Hugo Lauren\u00e7on, Andr\u00e9s Marafioti, Victor Sanh, and L\u00e9o Tronchon.\r\n\r\nIdefics3 is an adaptation of the Idefics2 model with three main differences:\r\n\r\n- It uses Llama3 for the text model.\r\n- It uses an updated processing logic for the images.\r\n- It removes the perceiver.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0804f078-31c0-48b4-8641-ce2166d7efbc)\r\n\r\n* Add Idefics 3!  by @andimarafioti in #32473\r\n\r\n### PhiMoE\r\n\r\nThe PhiMoE model was proposed in Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone by Microsoft.\r\n\r\nThis model is very similar to Mixtral with the main difference of Phi3LongRoPEScaledRotaryEmbedding, where they are \r\nused to extend the context of the rotary embeddings. The query, key and values are fused, and the MLP\u2019s up and gate \r\nprojection layers are also fused.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7af05d5-9b20-44f7-ab91-b6d3c490fd7b)\r\n\r\n* PhiMoE  by @garg-amit in #33363\r\n\r\n## Watermarking\r\n\r\nThis release adds [SynthID](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08025-4), a novel state-of-the-art watermarking technique by Google DeepMind. SynthID has a low generation-time computational cost and can be configured to be nearly imperceptible (at the cost of harder watermarking detection). The release also comes with the code to train and run the corresponding detector, which is a machine learning model itself.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, SynthIDTextWatermarkingConfig\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('google/gemma-2-2b', padding_side=\"left\")\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('google/gemma-2-2b')\r\n\r\n# SynthID Text configuration\r\nwatermarking_config = SynthIDTextWatermarkingConfig(\r\n    keys=[654, 400, 836, 123, 340, 443, 597, 160, 57],\r\n    ngram_len=5,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# Generation with watermarking\r\ntokenized_prompts = tokenizer([\"Once upon a time, \"], return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\r\noutput_sequences = model.generate(\r\n    **tokenized_prompts, watermarking_config=watermarking_config, do_sample=True, max_new_tokens=10\r\n)\r\nwatermarked_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_sequences, skip_special_tokens=True)\r\nprint(watermarked_text)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocs for applying SynthID watermarking: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/internal/generation_utils#transformers.SynthIDTextWatermarkLogitsProcessor\r\nDocs for detecting SynthID watermarking: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/internal/generation_utils#transformers.SynthIDTextWatermarkDetector\r\n\r\n<img width=\"750\" alt=\"how-synthid-works-high-level\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5702b21-e7e6-490d-8fe6-b73783e78e6b\">\r\n\r\n* Add SynthID (watermerking by Google DeepMind) by @gante in #34350\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n### BitNet\r\n[BitNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764) is an architecture introduced by Microsoft Research that uses extreme quantization, representing each parameter with only three values: -1, 0, and 1. This results in a model that uses just 1.58 bits per parameter, significantly reducing computational and memory requirements. It replaces traditional Linear layers in Multi-Head Attention and Feed-Forward Networks with specialized layers called BitLinears that use ternary precision (or even binary, in the initial version)\r\n![image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/1.58llm_extreme_quantization/bitlinear.png)\r\n* FEAT : Adding BitNet quantization method to HFQuantizer  by @MekkCyber in #33410\r\n\r\n### GGUF loading in transformers\r\n\r\nMore architectures are now supported in our GGUF loader; GGUF files saved with this architecture can now\r\nbe loaded directly in transformers to be fine-tuned. We recommend using tooling from llama.cpp to requantize\r\nthe models after further training has been done.\r\n\r\n* Add gguf support for bloom  by @VladOS95-cyber in #33473\r\n* Add falcon gguf  by @g-prz in #33437\r\n* Add gguf support for StableLM  by @VladOS95-cyber in #33793\r\n* Add gguf support for gpt2  by @VladOS95-cyber in #34044\r\n* Add GGUF for starcoder2  by @VladOS95-cyber in #34094\r\n\r\n## Notable improvements and additions\r\n\r\n### Pipeline API synchronisation\r\n\r\nWe are pushing for a unified inference API across multiple libraries. As part of this, we are cleaning up the input and output signatures for our pipeline classes and deprecating some rarely-used arguments. This is still a work-in-progress, but when it's finished, `transformers` pipelines should exactly match workflows in deployment libraries like [transformers.js](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js) or [TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index), allowing you to seamlessly move from development to production.\r\n\r\n* Sync video classification pipeline with huggingface_hub spec  by @Rocketknight1 in #34288\r\n* Image pipelines spec compliance  by @Rocketknight1 in #33899\r\n* Make ASR pipeline compliant with Hub spec + add tests  by @Rocketknight1 in #33769\r\n* Cleanup return_text and return_full_text options in TextGenerationPipeline  by @Rocketknight1 in #33542\r\n* Make audio classification pipeline spec-compliant and add test  by @Rocketknight1 in #33730\r\n* Sync QuestionAnsweringPipeline  by @Rocketknight1 in #34039\r\n\r\nAlso, pipelines now fully support the `Processor` class, used by vision-language models. Expect full pipeline support for chatting with VLMs in the very near future!\r\n\r\n* Make `pipeline` able to load `processor`  by @qubvel in #32514\r\n\r\n### Executorch compatibility\r\n\r\n[ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch) is an end-to-end solution for enabling on-device inference capabilities across mobile and edge devices including wearables, embedded devices and microcontrollers. It is part of the PyTorch ecosystem and supports the deployment of PyTorch models with a focus on portability, productivity, and performance.\r\n\r\nWe are collaborating with the executorch team so that \ud83e\udd17 Transformers models can be exported using `torch.export`. The goal of this integration is not only to enable export but also to ensure that the exported artifact can be further lowered and optimized to run efficiently in ExecuTorch, particularly for mobile and edge use cases.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"750\" alt=\"how-executorch-works-high-level\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e353f9c9-b3e8-4172-86e0-c9b0b1bdd17a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n* Generate

    "body": "## New model additions\r\n\r\n### mllama\r\n\r\nThe Llama 3.2-Vision collection of multimodal large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pretrained and instruction-tuned image reasoning generative models in 11B and 90B sizes (text + images in / text out). The Llama 3.2-Vision instruction-tuned models are optimized for visual recognition, image reasoning, captioning, and answering general questions about an image. The models outperform many of the available open source and closed multimodal models on common industry benchmarks.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b09ca55-b21c-4cea-80e7-32afc5ce8a76)\r\n\r\n- Add MLLama #33703, by @qubvel, @zucchini-nlp, @ArthurZucker \r\n\r\n### Qwen2-VL\r\n\r\nThe Qwen2-VL is a major update from the previous Qwen-VL by the Qwen team.\r\n\r\nAn extract from the Qwen2-VL blogpost available [here]() is as follows:\r\n\r\nQwen2-VL is the latest version of the vision language models based on Qwen2 in the Qwen model familities. Compared with Qwen-VL, Qwen2-VL has the capabilities of:\r\n- SoTA understanding of images of various resolution & ratio: Qwen2-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on visual understanding benchmarks, including MathVista, DocVQA, RealWorldQA, MTVQA, etc.\r\n- Understanding videos of 20min+: Qwen2-VL can understand videos over 20 minutes for high-quality video-based question answering, dialog, content creation, etc.\r\n- Agent that can operate your mobiles, robots, etc.: with the abilities of complex reasoning and decision making, Qwen2-VL can be integrated with devices like mobile phones, robots, etc., for automatic operation based on visual environment and text instructions.\r\n- Multilingual Support: to serve global users, besides English and Chinese, Qwen2-VL now supports the understanding of texts in different languages inside images, including most European languages, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese, etc.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5689792-a5dd-4989-b66c-2cf4d398e89e)\r\n\r\n* support qwen2-vl  by @simonJJJ in #32318\r\n\r\n### Qwen2-Audio\r\n\r\nThe Qwen2-Audio is the new model series of large audio-language models from the Qwen team. Qwen2-Audio is capable of accepting various audio signal inputs and performing audio analysis or direct textual responses with regard to speech instructions. \r\n\r\nThey introduce two distinct audio interaction modes:\r\n- voice chat: users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input\r\n- audio analysis: users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/221d8815-6657-4e25-b161-c1ca9728f89e)\r\n\r\n* Add Qwen2-Audio  by @faychu in #32137\r\n\r\n### OLMoE\r\n\r\nOLMoE is a series of **O**pen **L**anguage **M**odels using sparse **M**ixture-**o**f-**E**xperts designed to enable the science of language models. The team releases all code, checkpoints, logs, and details involved in training these models.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/948f5f52-7be6-47e2-9790-4d07cac26859)\r\n\r\n* Add OLMoE  by @Muennighoff in #32406\r\n\r\n## Llava Onevision\r\n\r\nLLaVA-Onevision is a Vision-Language Model that can generate text conditioned on one or several images/videos. The model consists of SigLIP vision encoder and a Qwen2 language backbone. The images are processed with anyres-9 technique where the image is split into 9 patches to better process high resolution images and capture as much details as possible. However, videos are pooled to a total sequence length of 196 tokens each frame for more memory efficient computation. LLaVA-Onevision is available in three sizes: 0.5B, 7B and 72B and achieves remarkable performance on benchmark evaluations.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c9e64a0-8ac9-4449-ba0e-a46cd434908e)\r\n\r\n* Llava Onevision: add model  by @zucchini-nlp in #32673\r\n\r\n### FalconMamba\r\n\r\nThe FalconMamba model was proposed by TII UAE (Technology Innovation Institute) in their release.\r\n\r\nThe model has been trained on approximtely 6T tokens consisting a mixture of many data sources such as RefineWeb, Cosmopedia and Math data.\r\n\r\nThe team releases an accompanying [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/falconmamba).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f081c6-36b8-4f66-9091-e760163c8a61)\r\n\r\n* Add new model  by @younesbelkada in #32615\r\n\r\n### Granite Language Models\r\n\r\nhe Granite model was proposed in [Power Scheduler: A Batch Size and Token Number Agnostic Learning Rate Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13359) by Yikang Shen, Matthew Stallone, Mayank Mishra, Gaoyuan Zhang, Shawn Tan, Aditya Prasad, Adriana Meza Soria, David D. Cox and Rameswar Panda.\r\n\r\nPowerLM-3B is a 3B state-of-the-art small language model trained with the Power learning rate scheduler. It is trained on a wide range of open-source and synthetic datasets with permissive licenses. PowerLM-3B has shown promising results compared to other models in the size categories across various benchmarks, including natural language multi-choices, code generation, and math reasoning.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2104b054-2490-41ec-ae09-bb37aad82fcc)\r\n\r\n* Granite language models  by @mayank31398 in #31502\r\n\r\n### Granite MOE\r\n\r\nThe GraniteMoe model was proposed in [Power Scheduler: A Batch Size and Token Number Agnostic Learning Rate Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13359) by Yikang Shen, Matthew Stallone, Mayank Mishra, Gaoyuan Zhang, Shawn Tan, Aditya Prasad, Adriana Meza Soria, David D. Cox and Rameswar Panda.\r\n\r\nPowerMoE-3B is a 3B sparse Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) language model trained with the Power learning rate scheduler. It sparsely activates 800M parameters for each token. It is trained on a mix of open-source and proprietary datasets. PowerMoE-3B has shown promising results compared to other dense models with 2x activate parameters across various benchmarks, including natural language multi-choices, code generation, and math reasoning.\r\n\r\n* Granitemoe  by @mayank31398 in #33207\r\n\r\n### Descript-Audio-Codec\r\n\r\nThe Descript Audio Codec (DAC) model is a powerful tool for compressing audio data, making it highly efficient for storage and transmission. By compressing 44.1 KHz audio into tokens at just 8kbps bandwidth, the DAC model enables high-quality audio processing while significantly reducing the data footprint. This is particularly useful in scenarios where bandwidth is limited or storage space is at a premium, such as in streaming applications, remote conferencing, and archiving large audio datasets.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd49392-c3dc-4c57-bfc5-dab41b7d0861)\r\n\r\n* Add Descript-Audio-Codec model  by @kamilakesbi in #31494\r\n\r\n### Pixtral\r\n\r\nThe Pixtral model was released by the Mistral AI team. Pixtral is a multimodal model, taking images and text as input, and producing text as output. This model follows the [Llava](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/llava) family, meaning image embeddings are placed instead of the [IMG] token placeholders. \r\n\r\nThe model uses [PixtralVisionModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/pixtral#transformers.PixtralVisionModel) for its vision encoder, and [MistralForCausalLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/mistral#transformers.MistralForCausalLM) for its language decoder. The main contribution is the 2d ROPE (rotary postiion embeddings) on the images, and support for arbitrary image sizes (the images are not padded together nor are they resized).\r\n\r\n* Add support for Pixtral  by @ArthurZucker in #33449\r\n\r\n### Mimi\r\n\r\nThe Mimi model was proposed in [Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue](https://kyutai.org/Moshi.pdf) by Alexandre D\u00e9fossez, Laurent Mazar\u00e9, Manu Orsini, Am\u00e9lie Royer, Patrick P\u00e9rez, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Edouard Grave and Neil Zeghidour. Mimi is a high-fidelity audio codec model developed by the Kyutai team, that combines semantic and acoustic information into audio tokens running at 12Hz and a bitrate of 1.1kbps. In other words, it can be used to map audio waveforms into \u201caudio tokens\u201d, known as \u201ccodebooks\u201d.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a45b304-5bcb-4c7b-984e-6c76f970b56f)\r\n\r\n* Codec integration  by @ylacombe in #33565\r\n\r\n### OmDet-Turbo\r\n\r\nThe OmDet-Turbo model was proposed in [Real-time Transformer-based Open-Vocabulary Detection with Efficient Fusion Head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06892) by Tiancheng Zhao, Peng Liu, Xuan He, Lu Zhang, Kyusong Lee. OmDet-Turbo incorporates components from RT-DETR and introduces a swift multimodal fusion module to achieve real-time open-vocabulary object detection capabilities while maintaining high accuracy. The base model achieves performance of up to 100.2 FPS and 53.4 AP on COCO zero-shot.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/848e91e3-81b9-4362-955a-519eaf9a871d)\r\n\r\n* Add OmDet-Turbo by @yonigozlan in #31843\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n### GGUF\r\n\r\nGGUF support continues to be enhanced in the library by offering a way to load GGUF models within `transformers` by unquantizing them, before re-quantizing them for re-use within the GGUF/GGML ecosystem.\r\n\r\n* Add Qwen2Moe GGUF loading support   by @VladOS95-cyber in #33264\r\n* Fix incorrect vocab size retrieval in GGUF config  by @Isotr0py in #32551\r\n* Add chat_template for tokenizer extracted from GGUF model  by @Isotr0py in #32908\r\n* \ud83d\udea8 Support dequantization for most GGML types  by @Isotr0py in #32625\r\n* Add support for GGUF Phi-3  by @a8nova in #31844\r\n\r\n### Torch AO\r\n\r\nAn ongoing effort is to add the ability to use `torchao` as a quantization backend. Future PRs will enable saving and fine-tuning with `peft`.\r\n\r\n* Add TorchAOHfQuantizer  by @jerryzh168 in #32306\r\n\r\n### Liger Kernel\r\n\r\nThe Liger kernel is now supported in the `Trainer` class.\r\n\r\n* Integrate Liger (Linkedin GPU Efficient Runtime) Kernel to Trainer  by @JasonZhu1313 in #32860\r\n\r\n## Modular Transformers\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces Modularity for transformers, which has always been prohibited when working with transformers (see [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/transformers-design-philosophy) for the accompanying design philosophy).\r\n\r\nThe core idea behind this PR is to facilitate model addition by enabling Pythonic inheritance while keeping true to our single-file policy in which models/processors must be contained within a single file, enabling working around the object without going through 10 layers of abstractions.\r\n\r\nIt is heavily recommended to read the PR description in order to understand the depth of the change: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/33248\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307f7415-54d2-4680-b056-aa88a6459777)\r\n\r\n* Modular `transformers`: modularity and inheritance for new model additions  by @ArthurZucker in #33248\r\n\r\n## Agents\r\n\r\n`Agents` continue being improved at each release; this time making it much simpler to leverage a local engine through a local Transformers Engine.\r\n\r\n* Multi agents with manager  by @aymeric-roucher in #32687\r\n* Add new documentation page for advanced agent usage  by @aymeric-roucher in #33265\r\n* Create local Transformers Engine  by @aymeric-roucher in #33218\r\n* Agents use grammar  by @aymeric-roucher in #31735\r\n\r\n## Dynamic cache for decoder-only models\r\n\r\nThis PR adds to all decoder-only models (except for XLNet) support for dynamic cache.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for the Dynamic cache can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.DynamicCache), and documentation related to the KV cache in `transformers` in general can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/kv_cache).\r\n\r\n* Cache: new Cache format in decoder-only models  by @zucchini-nlp in #31421\r\n\r\n## Chat templates updates\r\n\r\nWe've made several updates to our handling of chat models and chat templates. The most noticeable change is that **assistant prefill** is now supported. This means you can end a chat with an `assistant` message, and the model will continue that message instead of starting a new one, allowing you to guide the model's response:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npipe = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model_checkpoint)\r\n\r\nchat = [\r\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can you format the answer in JSON?\"},\r\n    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": '{\"name\": \"'}\r\n]\r\n\r\noutput = pipe(chat)   # The model will continue outputting JSON!\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've also enabled several new functionalities in Jinja that will allow more powerful templates in future, including [Loop Controls](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#loop-controls) and a `strftime_now` function that can get the current date and time, which is commonly used in system messages. For more details, see the updated [chat template docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating).\r\n\r\n* Enable some Jinja extensions and add datetime capabilities  by

    "body": "# Release v4.44.0: End to end compile generation!!! Gemma2 (with assisted decoding), Codestral (Mistral for code), Nemotron, Efficient SFT training, CPU Offloaded KVCache, torch export for static cache\r\n\r\nThis release comes a bit early in our cycle because we wanted to ship important and requested models along with improved performances for everyone! \r\n\r\nAll of these are included with examples in the awesome https://github.com/huggingface/local-gemma repository! \ud83c\udf88 We tried to share examples of what is now possible with all the shipped features! Kudos to @gante, @sanchit-gandhi and @xenova \r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udca5  End-to-end generation compile\r\n*Generate: end-to-end compilation #30788 by @gante*: `model.generate` now supports compiling! There are a few limitations, but here is a small snippet:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\nimport torch\r\nimport copy\r\n\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n    \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\"\r\n)\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B\")\r\n\r\n# compile generate\r\ncompiled_generate = torch.compile(model.generate, fullgraph=True, mode=\"reduce-overhead\")\r\n\r\n# compiled generate does NOT accept parameterization except a) model inputs b) a generation config\r\ngeneration_config = copy.deepcopy(model.generation_config)\r\ngeneration_config.pad_token_id = model.config.eos_token_id\r\n\r\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([\"Write a poem about the market crashing in summer\"], return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nmodel_inputs = model_inputs.to(model.device)\r\noutput_compiled = compiled_generate(**model_inputs, generation_config=generation_config)\r\nprint(output_compiled)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u26a1  3 to 5x compile speedup (compilation time \ud83d\udc40 not runtime)\r\n* 3-5x faster torch.compile forward compilation for autoregressive decoder models #32227* by @fxmarty . \r\nAs documented on the PR, this makes the whole generation a lot faster when you re-use the cache! \r\nYou can see this when you run `model.forward = torch.compile(model.forward, mode=\"reduce-overhead\", fullgraph=True)`\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udeb6 Offloaded KV cache: offload the cache to CPU when you are GPU poooooor \ud83d\ude80 \r\n* Offloaded KV Cache #31325* by @n17s : you just have to set `cache_implementation=\"offloaded\"` when calling `from_pretrained` or using this:\r\n``` python3\r\nfrom transformers import GenerationConfig\r\ngen_config = GenerationConfig(cache_implementation=\"offloaded\", # other generation options such as num_beams=4,num_beam_groups=2,num_return_sequences=4,diversity_penalty=1.0,max_new_tokens=50,early_stopping=True)\r\noutputs = model.generate(inputs[\"input_ids\"],generation_config=gen_config)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udce6  Torch export for static cache\r\n`pytorch` team gave us a great gift: you can now use `torch.export` directly compatible with [Executorch](https://pytorch.org/executorch/main/index.html)! Find examples [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/31706).\r\n\r\n* Make static cache compatible with torch.export #32168 by @guangy10 \r\n\r\nThis also unlocks support for prompt reuse:\r\n```python3\r\nimport os, torch, copy\r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, DynamicCache\r\ndevice = \"cuda\"\r\nckpt = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"\r\n\r\nINITIAL_PROMPT = \"From now on, you are going to answer all my questions with historical details. Make sure to always add a bit of french here and there, for style.\"\r\n\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(ckpt, torch_dtype=torch.float16)\r\nmodel.to(device)\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(ckpt)\r\n\r\nprompt_cache = DynamicCache()\r\ninputs = tokenizer(INITIAL_PROMPT, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\r\nprompt_cache = model(**inputs, past_key_values = prompt_cache).past_key_values\r\n\r\nprompt = \"Why are french people obsessed with french?\"\r\nnew_inputs = tokenizer(INITIAL_PROMPT + prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\r\npast_key_values = copy.deepcopy(prompt_cache)\r\noutputs = model.generate(**new_inputs, past_key_values=past_key_values,max_new_tokens=20) \r\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0]\r\nprint(response)\r\n\r\nprompt = \"What is the best city to swim in?\"\r\nnew_inputs = tokenizer(INITIAL_PROMPT + prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")\r\noutputs = model.generate(**new_inputs, past_key_values=copy.deepcopy(prompt_cache),max_new_tokens=20) \r\nresponse = tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs)[0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Gemma2: assisted decoding\r\n*Gemma 2: support assisted generation #32357* by @gante\r\n\r\nWe now have a 2B Gemma 2 model -- a perfect sidekick for the 27B with assisted generation. We've enabled assisted generation in gemma 2, with a caveat: assisted generation currently requires the use of a windowless cache (as opposed to the default cache for gemma 2), so you might observe some output mismatch on long sequences. Read more about it [here](https://huggingface.co/blog/gemma-july-update#assisted-generation).\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# transformers assisted generation reference: \r\n# https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/llm_optims#speculative-decoding \r\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\n# we DON\u2019T recommend using the 9b model with the 2b model as its assistant\r\nassistant_model_name = 'google/gemma-2-2b-it'\r\nreference_model_name = 'google/gemma-2-27b-it'\r\n\r\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(reference_model_name)\r\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n   reference_model_name, device_map='auto', torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\r\n)\r\nassistant_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\r\n   assistant_model_name, device_map='auto', torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16\r\n)\r\n\r\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer(\"Einstein's theory of relativity states\", return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\r\ngeneration_options = {\r\n   \"assistant_model\": assistant_model,\r\n   \"do_sample\": True,\r\n   \"temperature\": 0.7,\r\n   \"max_new_tokens\": 64,\r\n}\r\n\r\noutputs = model.generate(**model_inputs, **generation_options)\r\ntokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Nemotron support \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512d3fbe-909b-4e45-9927-cab78e0f522a)\r\n> Nemotron-4-340B-Instruct is a large language model (LLM) that can be used as part of a synthetic data generation pipeline to create training data that helps researchers and developers build their own LLMs. It is a fine-tuned version of the Nemotron-4-340B-Base model, optimized for English-based single and multi-turn chat use-cases. It supports a context length of 4,096 tokens.\r\n\r\nThe conversion script should be able to cover Minitron and Nemotron, thanks and kudos to @suiyoubi. See:\r\n* Add Nemotron HF Support #31699\r\n\r\n\r\n## Codestral support \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2827f950-f6c5-4fb8-8569-e8008aa79651)\r\n> Codestral is trained on a diverse dataset of 80+ programming languages, including the most popular ones, such as Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, and Bash. It also performs well on more specific ones like Swift and Fortran. This broad language base ensures Codestral can assist developers in various coding environments and projects.\r\n\r\nCodestral saves developers time and effort: it can complete coding functions, write tests, and complete any partial code using a fill-in-the-middle mechanism. Interacting with Codestral will help level up the developer\u2019s coding game and reduce the risk of errors and bugs.\r\n\r\nIt's mamba2 architecture, was a bit of a pain to remove all einops but hope we made it better for everyone!\r\n\r\n* Add codestral mamba2 #32080 by @molbap and @vasqu \r\n\r\n## Breaking changes: \r\nWe removed the chat template **in the code**, they should all be on the hub!\r\n* \ud83d\udea8 No more default chat templates #31733 by @Rocketknight1 \r\n\r\n## Long-form decoding for whisper, even faster:\r\nOur great @sanchit-gandhi worked on porting the recent compile upgrades to long form decoding in \r\n* [whisper] compile compatibility with long-form decoding #31772\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Enhancing SFT Training Efficiency Using Packing and FlashAttention2 with Position IDs by @RhuiDih in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/31629\r\n* Updated `ruff` to the latest version by @Sai-Suraj-27 in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/31926\r\n* fix by @gante in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32162\r\n* fix: Fixed an if condition that is always evaluating to true by @Sai-Suraj-27 in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32160\r\n* [docs] change temperature to a positive value by @faaany in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32077\r\n* adds: extra_repr() to MambaRMSNorm to include hidden size / size of weights in the layer by @rohitdwivedula in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32171\r\n* fix: default value reflects the runtime environment variables rather than the ones present at import time. by @junrae6454 in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32153\r\n* Update qwen2.md by @ArtificialZeng in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32108\r\n* Remove conversational pipeline tests by @amyeroberts in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32099\r\n* RoPE: relaxed rope validation by @gante in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32182\r\n* let's not warn when someone is running a forward  by @ArthurZucker in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32176\r\n* Fix resize embedding with Deepspeed by @zucchini-nlp in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32192\r\n* Fix float8_e4m3fn in modeling_utils by @SunMarc in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32193\r\n* Support dequantizing GGUF FP16 format by @PenutChen in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/31783\r\n* :rotating_light: No more default chat templates by @Rocketknight1 in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/31733\r\n* fix: Replaced deprecated `unittest method` with the correct one by @Sai-Suraj-27 in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32198\r\n* [whisper] fix short-form output type by @sanchit-gandhi in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32178\r\n* remove unnecessary guard code related with pytorch versions 1.4.2 ~ 1.7.0 by @statelesshz in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32210\r\n* Update question_answering.py by @avlewis in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32208\r\n* [BigBird Pegasus] set _supports_param_buffer_assignment to False by @kashif in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32222\r\n* [warnings] fix E721 warnings by @kashif in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32223\r\n* Follow up for #31973 by @ydshieh in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32025\r\n* translate philosophy.md to chinese by @statelesshz in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/32177\r\n* Allow a specific microphone to be used by the ffmpeg audio pipeline utility functions.
