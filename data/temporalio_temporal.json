    "body": "# Schema Changes\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.27.1, you must upgrade your core schema if you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL, and your visibility schema to the following:\r\n\r\n- Core:\r\n    - MySQL schema v1.16\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.16\r\n- Visibility:\r\n    - Elasticsearch schema v9\r\n    - MySQL schema 1.9\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.9\r\n\r\nPlease see our [upgrade documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server) for the necessary steps to upgrade your schemas.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The upgrade to MySQL and PostgreSQL Visibility schemas may come with temporary performance degradation because of creation of a new column `_version` which has default values. **Consider performing the schema upgrades when load is low.** There are protective mechanisms in place to account for timeouts from any VisibilityStore.\r\n\r\n# Deprecation of Visibility Scan APIs\r\n\r\nVisibility Scan APIs have been deprecated in favor of List Workflow APIs. Visibility Scan APIs will be removed in a future version. Migration to List Workflow APIs will be required in future versions.\r\n\r\n# Nexus GA\r\n\r\n[Nexus](https://docs.temporal.io/nexus) is now GA with a stable server API. \r\n\r\n[Read more here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md)\u00a0on how to disable Nexus or how to operate it here.\r\n\r\nNotable features and bug fixes since\u00a0`v1.26.2`:\r\n\r\n- The server now allows a maximum of 30 pending Nexus operations per workflow by default, as opposed to the previous limit being 30 total.\r\n- Add support for attaching callbacks, request IDs, and links to a workflow via `StartWorkflowExecutionRequest.OnConflictOptions` with `WorkflowIdConflictPolicy` of `USE_EXISTING`. This allows multiple operations to be backed by the same workflow.\r\n- Misc small features and tests.\r\n\r\n# Safe Deploys\r\n\r\nThe following APIs are added for Worker Versioning. All APIs are experimental and not yet recommended for production usage. You need to set the dynamic configs `system.enableDeployments` and `system.enableDeploymentVersions` in order to use them.\r\n\r\n- ListWorkerDeployments\r\n- DescribeWorkerDeployment\r\n- DescribeWorkerDeploymentVersion\r\n- SetWorkerDeploymentCurrentVersion\r\n- SetWorkerDeploymentRampingVersion\r\n- UpdateWorkerVersionMetadata\r\n- DeleteWorkerDeployment\r\n- DeleteWorkerDeploymentVersion\r\n\r\nThe following APIs are now deprecated and replaced by above:\r\n\r\n- ~~DescribeDeployment~~\r\n- ~~ListDeployments~~\r\n- ~~GetDeploymentReachability~~\r\n- ~~GetCurrentDeployment~~\r\n- ~~SetCurrentDeployment~~\r\n\r\n# Activity Commands (pre-release)\r\n\r\nChanges to the Activity Commands \u2014 a set of APIs designed to resolve issues related to activity execution. The following APIs where updated:\r\n\r\n- `UpdateActivityOptionsById` was renamed to `UpdateActivityOptions`. This API can be used by the client to update the options of an activity while activity is running.\r\n- `PauseActivityById` was renamed to `PauseActivity`. With this API, If the Activity is not currently running (e.g. because it previously failed and is waiting for the next retry), it will not be run again until it is unpaused.\r\n    - `activity_type` parameter was added. If this parameter is set - all running activities of this type will be paused.\r\n- `UnpauseActivityById` was renamed to `UnpauseActivity`. With this API clients can re-schedule a previously-paused Activity for execution.\r\n    - `no_wait` parameter was removed\r\n    - `activity_type` parameter was added. If this parameter is set - all paused activities of this type will be unpaused.\r\n    - `match-all` parameter was added. If this parameter is set - all paused activities will be unpaused.\r\n    - `jitter` parameter was added. If set, the activity will start at a random time within the specified jitter duration.\r\n- `ResetActivityById` was renamed to `ResetActivity`. With this API clients can reset the execution of an activity, specified by its ID or type.\r\n    - `no_wait`  parameter was removed\r\n    - `activity_type` parameter was added. If this parameter is provided - all paused activities of this type will be unpaused.\r\n    - `keep_paused` parameter was added. If this parameter is provided - all paused activities will stay paused.  Otherwise they will be unpaused.\r\n    - `jitter` parameter was added. If set, the activity will start at a random time within the specified jitter duration.\r\n- New batch operation was introduced - `BatchOperationUnpauseActivities`.\r\n\r\n# Workflow Reset with children\r\n\r\nIn this release we have added the functionality to reset a workflow with a pending child. \r\n\r\nPrior to this release reseting to a point between child workflow initiated and child workflow completed was not supported (the reset operation would fail). In the current release the reset operation will allow this case and the behavior of the parent after reset is to reconnect to the running child. The new run of the parent will receive the child\u2019s completion event and result (if any) from the child. \r\n\r\nThe feature is gated behind a per namespace boolean dynamic configuration `AllowResetWithPendingChildren` which is enabled by default for all namespaces. \r\n\r\nNote: If you are using Go-SDK and are relying on the SDK to generate child workflow IDs then you need to update it to the latest version to be able to use this feature. Other SDKs don\u2019t need any upgrade to use this feature.\r\n\r\n# Delete namespace improvement\r\n\r\n1. Delete workflow executions RPS is now dynamic. Previously, `frontend.deleteNamespaceDeleteActivityRPS` was read only once when namespace deletion started, and subsequent changes to this dynamic config didn't affect the ongoing deletion. This was inconvenient for large namespaces since the default RPS is only `100`. Now the RPS can be adjusted on the fly.\r\n    \r\n    Please note: Since deletion of Workflow Execution is an asynchronous process, this RPS controls the rate at which delete execution tasks are created. Decreasing this value (for example, from `1000` to `10`) won't immediately slow down the process, as existing tasks in the transfer queue must be processed first.\r\n    \r\n2. `DeleteExecutionsWorkflow` now supports a `stats` query to track its progress. Since this Workflow can run for hours after a namespace is marked as deleted, it was previously difficult to monitor how many Workflow Executions remained. The new query handler provides current statistics about total and remaining executions.\r\n\r\n3. Metrics and logging have been enhanced for better actionability. Key improvements include:\r\n    1. Monitor `ReclaimResources` workflow failures using the metrics `reclaim_resources_namespace_delete_failure` and `reclaim_resources_delete_executions_failure`.\r\n    2. Track `DeleteExecutionsWorkflow` progress using the metrics `delete_executions_success` and `delete_executions_failure`.\r\n\r\n4. Business critical namespaces can be protected from deletion. Use dynamic config to list namespaces which are not deletable:\r\n    \r\n    ```yaml\r\n    worker.protectedNamespaces:\r\n      - value:\r\n          - critical_namespace\r\n          - just_very_important_namespace\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n5. Sleep duration in `ReclaimResourcesWorkflow` now supports dynamic changes. If a namespace delete delay was mistakenly set too long, you can now modify it after the Workflow has started. Use this command to update the delay to a new value (10 hours in this example):\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    temporal workflow update --namespace temporal-system --name update_namespace_delete_delay --workflow-id temporal-sys-reclaim-namespace-resources-workflow/default-deleted-93f5e --input '\"10h\"'\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Or use this command to remove the delay entirely:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    temporal workflow update --namespace temporal-system --name update_namespace_delete_delay --workflow-id temporal-sys-reclaim-namespace-resources-workflow/default-deleted-93f5e --input '\"0\"'\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Please note: The new delay starts from when it is set, not from when the original timer was created. For example, if the Workflow has already slept for 2 hours and the timer is updated to `10h`, it will sleep for another 10 hours, not 8.\r\n\r\n# Scheduled Actions\r\n\r\n- Scheduler workflow version has been updated.\r\n    - `FutureActionTimes` now accounts for a schedule\u2019s update time and `RemainingActions`.\r\n    - `ScheduleActionResult` now includes a `WorkflowExecutionStatus` field, providing an eventually-consistent view of a workflow\u2019s status within List results.\r\n- Bugfix: Queries on schedules might have been delayed after dynamic config changes were applied to per-namespace workers. An anti-entropy mechanism has been added to the per-namespace worker component.\r\n\r\n# Fix out-of-order Visibility tasks with SQL database\r\n\r\nAll SQL stores used for Visibility had the rare possibility to perform updates to a workflow's visibility state out-of-order. This could result in Workflows occasionally appearing to have state that is out of date.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed by adding a new column `_version` to all SQL store implementations. Queries to update Visibility data now ensure the `_version` advances before performing any writes.\r\n\r\nUpdates to Visibility data are prepared by checking actual Workflow state. Therefore when a write is rejected for being out-of-order, we know the VisibilityStore already contains a equal or more up-to-date state, so we drop out-of-order updates silently.\r\n\r\n### Important Notes\r\n\r\n- Make sure to upgrade your Schemas before advancing your temporal version. See the **Schema Changes** section.\r\n- This will likely reduce the performance of SQL VisibilityStores.\r\n- We suggest ElasticSearch as the performant solution for VisibilityStore.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n### Docker images for this release (use the tag `1.27.1`)\r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup))\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/compare/v1.26.2...v1.27.1"

    "body": "> [!CAUTION] \r\n> Please DO NOT use it if you are using SQL-based (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or sqlite) persistence. Update directly to [v1.27.1](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.27.1).\r\n> This release made changes to the SQL schemas, and there's a bug when upgrading from an older version.\r\n\r\n# Schema Changes\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.27.0, you must upgrade your core schema if you are using MySQL or PostgreSQL, and your visibility schema to the following:\r\n\r\n- Core:\r\n    - MySQL schema v1.15\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.15\r\n- Visibility:\r\n    - Elasticsearch schema v9\r\n    - MySQL schema 1.9\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.9\r\n\r\nPlease see our [upgrade documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server) for the necessary steps to upgrade your schemas.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The upgrade to MySQL and PostgreSQL Visibility schemas may come with temporary performance degradation because of creation of a new column `_version` which has default values. **Consider performing the schema upgrades when load is low.** There are protective mechanisms in place to account for timeouts from any VisibilityStore.\r\n\r\n# Deprecation of Visibility Scan APIs\r\n\r\nVisibility Scan APIs have been deprecated in favor of List Workflow APIs. Visibility Scan APIs will be removed in a future version. Migration to List Workflow APIs will be required in future versions.\r\n\r\n# Nexus GA\r\n\r\n[Nexus](https://docs.temporal.io/nexus) is now GA with a stable server API. \r\n\r\n[Read more here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md)\u00a0on how to disable Nexus or how to operate it here.\r\n\r\nNotable features and bug fixes since\u00a0`v1.26.2`:\r\n\r\n- The server now allows a maximum of 30 pending Nexus operations per workflow by default, as opposed to the previous limit being 30 total.\r\n- Add support for attaching callbacks, request IDs, and links to a workflow via `StartWorkflowExecutionRequest.OnConflictOptions` with `WorkflowIdConflictPolicy` of `USE_EXISTING`. This allows multiple operations to be backed by the same workflow.\r\n- Misc small features and tests.\r\n\r\n# Safe Deploys\r\n\r\nThe following APIs are added for Worker Versioning. All APIs are experimental and not yet recommended for production usage. You need to set the dynamic configs `system.enableDeployments` and `system.enableDeploymentVersions` in order to use them.\r\n\r\n- ListWorkerDeployments\r\n- DescribeWorkerDeployment\r\n- DescribeWorkerDeploymentVersion\r\n- SetWorkerDeploymentCurrentVersion\r\n- SetWorkerDeploymentRampingVersion\r\n- UpdateWorkerVersionMetadata\r\n- DeleteWorkerDeployment\r\n- DeleteWorkerDeploymentVersion\r\n\r\nThe following APIs are now deprecated and replaced by above:\r\n\r\n- ~~DescribeDeployment~~\r\n- ~~ListDeployments~~\r\n- ~~GetDeploymentReachability~~\r\n- ~~GetCurrentDeployment~~\r\n- ~~SetCurrentDeployment~~\r\n\r\n# Activity Commands (pre-release)\r\n\r\nChanges to the Activity Commands \u2014 a set of APIs designed to resolve issues related to activity execution. The following APIs where updated:\r\n\r\n- `UpdateActivityOptionsById` was renamed to `UpdateActivityOptions`. This API can be used by the client to update the options of an activity while activity is running.\r\n- `PauseActivityById` was renamed to `PauseActivity`. With this API, If the Activity is not currently running (e.g. because it previously failed and is waiting for the next retry), it will not be run again until it is unpaused.\r\n    - `activity_type` parameter was added. If this parameter is set - all running activities of this type will be paused.\r\n- `UnpauseActivityById` was renamed to `UnpauseActivity`. With this API clients can re-schedule a previously-paused Activity for execution.\r\n    - `no_wait` parameter was removed\r\n    - `activity_type` parameter was added. If this parameter is set - all paused activities of this type will be unpaused.\r\n    - `match-all` parameter was added. If this parameter is set - all paused activities will be unpaused.\r\n    - `jitter` parameter was added. If set, the activity will start at a random time within the specified jitter duration.\r\n- `ResetActivityById` was renamed to `ResetActivity`. With this API clients can unpauses the execution of a previously paused activity, specified by its ID.\r\n    - `no_wait`  parameter was removed\r\n    - `activity_type` parameter was added. If this parameter is provided - all paused activities of this type will be unpaused.\r\n    - `keep_paused` parameter was added. If this parameter is provided - all paused activities will stay paused.  Otherwise they will be unpaused.\r\n    - `jitter` parameter was added. If set, the activity will start at a random time within the specified jitter duration.\r\n- New batch operation was introduced - `BatchOperationUnpauseActivities`.\r\n\r\n# Workflow Reset with children\r\n\r\nIn this release we have added the functionality to reset a workflow with a pending child. \r\n\r\nPrior to this release reseting to a point between child workflow initiated and child workflow completed was not supported (the reset operation would fail). In the current release the reset operation will allow this case and the behavior of the parent after reset is to reconnect to the running child. The new run of the parent will receive the child\u2019s completion event and result (if any) from the child. \r\n\r\nThe feature is gated behind a per namespace boolean dynamic configuration `AllowResetWithPendingChildren` which is enabled by default for all namespaces. \r\n\r\nNote: If you are using Go-SDK and are relying on the SDK to generate child workflow IDs then you need to update it to the latest version to be able to use this feature. Other SDKs don\u2019t need any upgrade to use this feature.\r\n\r\n# Delete namespace improvement\r\n\r\n1. Delete workflow executions RPS is now dynamic. Previously, `frontend.deleteNamespaceDeleteActivityRPS` was read only once when namespace deletion started, and subsequent changes to this dynamic config didn't affect the ongoing deletion. This was inconvenient for large namespaces since the default RPS is only `100`. Now the RPS can be adjusted on the fly.\r\n    \r\n    Please note: Since deletion of Workflow Execution is an asynchronous process, this RPS controls the rate at which delete execution tasks are created. Decreasing this value (for example, from `1000` to `10`) won't immediately slow down the process, as existing tasks in the transfer queue must be processed first.\r\n    \r\n2. `DeleteExecutionsWorkflow` now supports a `stats` query to track its progress. Since this Workflow can run for hours after a namespace is marked as deleted, it was previously difficult to monitor how many Workflow Executions remained. The new query handler provides current statistics about total and remaining executions.\r\n\r\n3. Metrics and logging have been enhanced for better actionability. Key improvements include:\r\n    1. Monitor `ReclaimResources` workflow failures using the metrics `reclaim_resources_namespace_delete_failure` and `reclaim_resources_delete_executions_failure`.\r\n    2. Track `DeleteExecutionsWorkflow` progress using the metrics `delete_executions_success` and `delete_executions_failure`.\r\n\r\n4. Business critical namespaces can be protected from deletion. Use dynamic config to list namespaces which are not deletable:\r\n    \r\n    ```yaml\r\n    worker.protectedNamespaces:\r\n      - value:\r\n          - critical_namespace\r\n          - just_very_important_namespace\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n5. Sleep duration in `ReclaimResourcesWorkflow` now supports dynamic changes. If a namespace delete delay was mistakenly set too long, you can now modify it after the Workflow has started. Use this command to update the delay to a new value (10 hours in this example):\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    temporal workflow update --namespace temporal-system --name update_namespace_delete_delay --workflow-id temporal-sys-reclaim-namespace-resources-workflow/default-deleted-93f5e --input '\"10h\"'\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Or use this command to remove the delay entirely:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    temporal workflow update --namespace temporal-system --name update_namespace_delete_delay --workflow-id temporal-sys-reclaim-namespace-resources-workflow/default-deleted-93f5e --input '\"0\"'\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    Please note: The new delay starts from when it is set, not from when the original timer was created. For example, if the Workflow has already slept for 2 hours and the timer is updated to `10h`, it will sleep for another 10 hours, not 8.\r\n\r\n# Scheduled Actions\r\n\r\n- Scheduler workflow version has been updated.\r\n    - `FutureActionTimes` now accounts for a schedule\u2019s update time and `RemainingActions`.\r\n    - `ScheduleActionResult` now includes a `WorkflowExecutionStatus` field, providing an eventually-consistent view of a workflow\u2019s status within List results.\r\n- Bugfix: Queries on schedules might have been delayed after dynamic config changes were applied to per-namespace workers. An anti-entropy mechanism has been added to the per-namespace worker component.\r\n\r\n# Fix out-of-order Visibility tasks with SQL database\r\n\r\nAll SQL stores used for Visibility had the rare possibility to perform updates to a workflow's visibility state out-of-order. This could result in Workflows occasionally appearing to have state that is out of date.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed by adding a new column `_version` to all SQL store implementations. Queries to update Visibility data now ensure the `_version` advances before performing any writes.\r\n\r\nUpdates to Visibility data are prepared by checking actual Workflow state. Therefore when a write is rejected for being out-of-order, we know the VisibilityStore already contains a equal or more up-to-date state, so we drop out-of-order updates silently.\r\n\r\n### Important Notes\r\n\r\n- Make sure to upgrade your Schemas before advancing your temporal version. See the **Schema Changes** section.\r\n- This will likely reduce the performance of SQL VisibilityStores.\r\n- We suggest ElasticSearch as the performant solution for VisibilityStore.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n### Docker images for this release (use the tag `1.27.0`)\r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup))\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/compare/v1.26.2...v1.27.0\r\n",

    "body": "# Visibility schema changes\r\n\r\n`TemporalPauseInfo` column was added to visibility. `TemporalPauseInfo` contains search attribute related to paused entities in temporal workflows.\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.26.2, you must upgrade your visibility schemas to the following:\r\n\r\n- Visibility:\r\n    - Elasticsearch schema v8\r\n    - MySQL schema 1.7\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.7\r\n\r\n# Batch metrics (wide events)\r\n\r\nPR: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/6655\r\n\r\nDescription: Extended `metrics.Handler` interface with a new `StartBatch` method. StartBatch returns a BatchHandler that can be used to send a sequence of metrics as a single event when Close() is called on the batch. All provided metric handlers have been updated with the new interface and simply send metrics individually.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udca5\u00a0BREAKING CHANGE \ud83d\udca5 If you provide a custom metrics handler with `temporal.WithCustomMetricsHandler(metricsHandler)` you will need to implement `StartBatch()` on that handler. [See the tally metrics handler for an example of this.](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/2eb04bf7176a84aead476fa2564d88a835c75444/common/metrics/tally_metrics_handler.go#L123-L129)\r\n\r\n# Versioning / safe deploy (pre-release)\r\n\r\nThe following EXPERIMENTAL Versioning APIs are added in this release:\r\n\r\n- Deployment APIs, for managing worker deployments:\r\n    - `DescribeDeployment`\r\n    - `ListDeployments`\r\n    - `GetCurrentDeployment`\r\n    - `SetCurrentDeployment`\r\n    - `GetDeploymentReachability`\r\n- `UpdateWorkflowExecutionOptions`\u00a0API (and its batch mode) for setting versioning override for executions.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is not available at this point. Do not use above APIs in production.\r\n\r\nTo enable these APIs the following configs should be enabled: `system.enableDeployments` and `frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs`.\r\n\r\n# Workflow Update GA\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\n\r\nWorkflow Update enables a gRPC client of a Workflow Execution to issue requests to that Workflow Execution and receive a response. These requests are delivered to and processed by a client-specified Workflow Execution. Updates are differentiated from Queries in that the processing of an Update is allowed to modify the state of a Workflow Execution. Updates are different from Signals in that an Update returns a response.\r\n\r\nAny gRPC client can invoke Updates via the\u00a0`WorkflowService.UpdateWorkflowExecution`. Additionally, past Update requests can be observed via the\u00a0`WorkflowService.PollWorkflowExecutionUpdate`\u00a0API. The wait stage option determines whether they respond once the Update was\u00a0*accepted*\u00a0or\u00a0*completed*.\r\n\r\nNote that an Update only becomes durable when it was\u00a0*accepted*, until then, it will not appear in the Workflow history. SDKs will automatically retry to ensure Update requests complete.\r\n\r\nThe execution and retention of Updates is configured via two optional dynamic configuration values:\r\n\r\n- `history.maxTotalUpdates`\u00a0controls the total number of Updates that a single Workflow Execution can support. The default is 2000.\r\n- `history.maxInFlightUpdates`\u00a0controls the number of Updates that can be \u201cin-flight\u201d (that is, concurrently executing, not having completed) for a given Workflow Execution. The default is 10.\r\n\r\nSince the 1.25 release, several minor bugs have been fixed.\r\n\r\n# Workflow Update-With-Start (public preview)\r\n\r\nUpdate-With-Start sends a Workflow Update that checks whether an already-running Workflow with that ID exists. If it does, the Update is processed. If not, it starts a new Workflow Execution with the supplied ID. When starting a new Workflow, it immediately processes the Update.\r\n\r\nUpdate-With-Start is great for latency-sensitive use cases.\r\n\r\n# Activity API (pre-release)\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\n\r\nWe introduce the Activity API \u2014 a set of APIs designed to resolve issues related to activity execution. The following  APIs where introduced:\r\n\r\n- UpdateActivityOptionsById. This API can be used by the client to update the options of an activity while activity is running.\r\n    - The following options are supported:\r\n        - task-queue\r\n        - schedule-to-close-timeout\r\n        - schedule-to-start-timeout\r\n        - start-to-close-timeout\r\n        - heartbeat-timeout\r\n        - retry-initial-interval\r\n        - retry-maximum-interval\r\n        - retry-backoff-coefficient\r\n        - retry-maximum-attempts\r\n    - Partial updates are supported.\r\n    - Timeout updates are effective immediately.\r\n- PauseActivityById. With this API, If the Activity is not currently running (e.g. because it previously failed and is waiting for the next retry), it will not be run again until it is unpaused.\r\n    - However, if the Activity is currently running, it will run to completion. If the Activity is on its last retry attempt and fails, the failure will be returned to the caller, just as if the Activity had not been paused. Otherwise, if it fails, it will enter a paused state.\r\n- UnpauseActivityById . With this API clients can re-schedule a previously-paused Activity for execution.\r\n    - If the Activity is not running and has exceeded its retry timeout, it will be scheduled immediately. Otherwise, it will be scheduled when its retry timeout expires. The Activity can be retried immediately using `--no-wait`.\r\n- ResetActivityById. With this API clients can unpauses the execution of a previously paused activity, specified by its ID.\r\n    - Resetting an activity means:\r\n        - number of attempts will be reset to 0.\r\n        - activity timeouts will be reset.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is not available at this point. Do not use above APIs in production.\r\n\r\n# Nexus\r\n\r\n[Nexus](https://docs.temporal.io/nexus) is still in public preview for this release, but has now been enabled by default.\r\n\r\n[Read more here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md)\u00a0on how to disable Nexus or how to operate it here.\r\n\r\nNotable features and bug fixes since `v1.25.2`:\r\n\r\n- [Allow completing a Nexus operation after workflow reset (](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/commit/34e628e104c870f0df28c0b641821396fd9c9fc7)[#6434](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/6434)[)](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/commit/34e628e104c870f0df28c0b641821396fd9c9fc7).\r\n- Fix a few issues around replication and cancelation.\r\n- Record NexusOperationStarted event and link when async operation completion races with the sync response path.\r\n- Support for full Temporal Failure rehydration and encryption. Nexus handlers and workflows backing operations will now expose the full error details by default. Caller workflows will also rehydrate the original error to allow for better E2E debugging experience.\r\n- Allow skipping application of Nexus events when resetting a workflow.\r\n\r\n# Notable bug fixes\r\n\r\nPrimary engineer: @prathyushpv  \r\n\r\nTable not found bug in sqlite.\r\n\r\nDurations with mismatched seconds and nanoseconds signs will now fail validation and return an InvalidArgument error.\r\n\r\n### Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n### Docker images for this release (use the tag `1.26.2`)\r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup))\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/compare/v1.25.2...v1.26.2\r\n",

    "body": "## Schema changes\r\nBefore upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.25.0, you must upgrade your core and visibility schemas to the following:\r\n\r\n- Core:\r\n    - MySQL schema v1.14\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.14\r\n    - Cassandra schema v1.11\r\n- Visibility:\r\n    - Elasticsearch schema v7\r\n    - MySQL schema 1.6\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.6\r\n\r\nPlease see our [upgrade documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server) for the necessary steps to upgrade your schemas.\r\n\r\n## Release Highlights\r\n\r\n### 1. Nexus\r\n\r\nNexus RPC is an open-source service framework for arbitrary-length operations whose lifetime may extend beyond a traditional RPC. It is an underpinning connecting durable executions within and across namespaces, clusters and regions \u2013 with an API contract designed with multi-team collaboration in mind. A service can be exposed as a set of sync or async Nexus operations \u2013 the latter provides an operation identifier and a uniform interface to get the status of an operation or its result, receive a completion callback, or cancel the operation.\r\n\r\nTemporal uses the Nexus RPC protocol to allow calling across namespace and cluster boundaries. The\u00a0[Go SDK Nexus proposal](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/blob/master/nexus/sdk-go.md)\u00a0explains the user experience and shows sequence diagrams from an external perspective.\r\n\r\n[Read more here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/architecture/nexus.md) on how to enable Nexus and how to operate it here.\r\n\r\n### 2. Workflow Update (public preview)\r\n\r\nWorkflow Update enables a gRPC client of a Workflow Execution to issue requests to that Workflow Execution and receive a response. These requests are delivered to and processed by a client-specified Workflow Execution. Updates are differentiated from Queries in that the processing of an Update is allowed to modify the state of a Workflow Execution. Updates are different from Signals in that an Update returns a response.\r\n\r\nAny gRPC client can invoke Updates via the `WorkflowService.UpdateWorkflowExecution`. Additionally, past Update requests can be observed via the `WorkflowService.PollWorkflowExecutionUpdate` API. The wait stage option determines whether they respond once the Update was *accepted* or *completed*.\r\n\r\nNote that an Update only becomes durable when it was *accepted*, until then, it will not appear in the Workflow history. SDKs will automatically retry to ensure Update requests complete.\r\n\r\nThe execution and retention of Updates is configured via two optional dynamic configuration values:\r\n\r\n- `history.maxTotalUpdates` controls the total number of Updates that a single Workflow Execution can support. The default is 2000.\r\n- `history.maxInFlightUpdates` controls the number of Updates that can be \u201cin-flight\u201d (that is, concurrently executing, not having completed) for a given Workflow Execution. The default is 10.\r\n\r\nSince the 1.21 release, the feature was heavily tested and several bug fixes as well as performance optimizations were made.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information at [this link](https://docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/workflow-message-passing#sending-updates).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. Host level MutableState cache\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `MutableState` cache has been updated to operate as a host-level cache by default. Previously, this cache was managed at the shard level, with each shard cache holding 512 `MutableState` entries. Now, the host-level cache, enabled by default (`history.enableHostHistoryCache = true`), will be shared across all shards on a given host.\r\n\r\nThe size of the host-level cache is controlled by the `history.hostLevelCacheMaxSize` configuration, which is set to 128,000 entries by default. This change may impact the memory usage of the history service, but it can be adjusted by modifying the `history.hostLevelCacheMaxSize` value.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. Visibility Enhancement\r\n\r\nEnhanced the Nexus CLI to support query filtering for the `schedule list` command. The `--query` or `-q` (string) option allows filtering of results using a specified list filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5. Task Queue Statistics\r\n\r\nProvide stats for Task Queue backlogs to be used for worker scaling decisions.\r\n\r\nUser `DescribeTaskQueue` API in enhanced mode (with `report_stats=true`) to get the following info about the Task Queue:\r\n\r\n* Approximate backlog count\r\n* Approximate backlog age\r\n* Approximate rate of adding tasks to the task queue\r\n* Approximate rate of dispatching tasks from the task queue\r\n\r\n\r\n## Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n## Docker images for this release \r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server) (use the tag `1.25.0`)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?] (https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup)) (use the tag `1.25.0`)\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools) (use the tag `1.25.0-tctl-1.18.1-cli-1.0.0`)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/compare/v1.24.0...v1.25.0\r\n",

    "body": "> [!CAUTION]  \r\n> This release introduces a [bug](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6050) in SQL visibility. Please DO NOT use it if you are using SQL-based (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or sqlite) visibility. Elasticsearch based visibility is not affected. Update directly to [v1.24.1](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.24.1).\r\n\r\n## Schema changes\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.24.0, you must upgrade your core and visibility schemas to the following:\r\n\r\n- Core:\r\n    - MySQL schema v1.12\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.12\r\n    - Cassandra schema v1.10\r\n- Visibility:\r\n    - Elasticsearch schema v7\r\n    - MySQL schema 1.5\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.5\r\n\r\nPlease see our [upgrade\u00a0documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide/upgrade-server)\u00a0for the necessary steps to upgrade your schemas.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Standard Visibility\r\n\r\nAs planned, standard visibility is no longer supported in this version. Please, upgrade to advanced visibility as well as the config keys to setup visibility before upgrading to this version. Refer to [v1.20.0 release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.20.0) for upgrade instructions, and also check the [v1.21.0 release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.21.0) for config key changes.\r\n\r\nNote that you also need to update the plugin name for the main store, ie., if you are using `mysql` plugin name for the main store, then you need to change to `mysql8`. Similarly, if it's `postgres`, then change it to `postgres12`.\r\n\r\n## Deprecation Announcements\r\n\r\n### Worker Versioning APIs [Experimental]\r\n\r\nThe following changes were made to Worker Versioning APIs:\r\n\r\n- Deprecated\u00a0`UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`\u00a0in favor of the new \u00a0`UpdateWorkerVersioningRules` API.\r\n- Deprecated\u00a0`GetWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`\u00a0in favor of the new\u00a0`GetWorkerVersioningRules` API.\r\n- Deprecated `GetWorkerTaskReachability` in favor of `DescribeTaskQueue` enhanced mode (`api_mode=ENHANCED`)\r\n\r\nTogether with the old APIs, the Version Set concept is also deprecated and replaced with \u201cversioning rules\u201d which are more powerful and flexible. More details can be found in https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/master/temporal/api/taskqueue/v1/message.proto#L153.\r\n\r\nFor using these experimental APIs you need to enable the following configs:\r\n- `frontend.workerVersioningRuleAPIs`\r\n- `frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Release Highlights\r\n\r\n### Namespace Burst Ratio\r\n\r\nRemoving `frontend.namespaceBurst` and adding `frontend.namespaceBurstRatio` config. Similarly replacing `frontend.namespaceBurst.visibility` and `frontend.namespaceBurst.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs` with `frontend.namespaceBurstRatio.visibility` and `frontend.namespaceBurstRatio.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs`.\r\n\r\nThe old values are used to specify the burst rate as number of requests per second. New values will specify burst as a ratio of their respective RPS limit. This ratio will be applied to calculated RPS limit from global and per-instance rate limits.\r\n\r\n### Visibility: Parent workflow execution\r\n\r\nWe added two new system search attributes: `RootWorkflowId` and `RootRunId`. If you have previously created custom search attributes with one of these names, attempts to set them will start to fail. We suggest updating your workflows to not set those search attributes, delete those search attributes and then upgrade Temporal to this version. Alternatively, you can also set the dynamic config `system.supressErrorSetSystemSearchAttribute: true`. When this dynamic config is set to `true`, your workflow will not fail when trying to set a value on a system search attribute, and it will ignore your input for those system search attributes.\r\n\r\n### OpenAPI HTTP API Documentation\r\n\r\nOpenAPI v2 docs are served at `/api/v1/swagger.json` while v3 is at `/api/v1/openapi.yaml` when our HTTP API is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Shard Info Update Optimizations\r\n\r\nOperators can now configure how often we update shard info (tracking how many tasks have been acked, etc). This improves recovery speed by persisting shard data more frequently.\r\n\r\nThis can be configured through the following dynamic config values:\r\n\r\n- `history.shardUpdateMinTasksCompleted` - the minimum number of tasks which must be completed (across all queues) before the shard info can be updated\r\n- `history.shardUpdateMinInterval` - the minimum amount of time between shard info updates *unless* `shardUpdateMinTasksCompleted` tasks have been acked\r\n\r\nNote that once `history.shardUpdateMinInterval amount` of time has passed we'll update the shard info regardless of the number of tasks completed\r\n\r\n### Interpolate MySQL query parameters by default (#5428)\r\n\r\nWe now interpolate parameters into queries client-side for MySQL main databases but not visibility.\r\n\r\nWhen `interpolateParams` is false (the default) the driver will prepare parameterized statements before  executing them, meaning we need two round-trips to the database for each query. By setting `interpolateParams` to true the DB driver will handle interpolation and send the query just  once to the database, halving the number of round trips necessary. This  should improve the performance of all Temporal deploys using MySQL.\r\n\r\n### OpenTelemetry env variables\r\n\r\nSupport for enabling OpenTelemetry for tracing gRPC requests via environment variables. See `develop/docs/tracing.md` for details.\r\n\r\n### Matching task queue handover\r\n\r\nVarious improvements were made to task queue handover when adding/removing/restarting matching nodes. This should improve tail latency for task dispatch during those situations. To enable the improvements, operators should set the dynamic config `matching.alignMembershipChange` to a value like `10s` **after fully deploying** v1.24 to the entire cluster. This may become the default in future versions.\r\n\r\n### UTF-8 validation in protobuf messages\r\n\r\nWhen we migrated Temporal from the deprecated gogoproto fork of Google\u2019s protobuf library to the official version in v1.23, we disabled protobuf\u2019s default utf-8 validation to ensure a smooth deployment, since gogoproto did not validate fields for utf-8, and turning on validation immediately would have broken applications that accidentally used invalid utf-8.\r\n\r\nThis was a temporary measure and we will eventually re-enable validation. As the first step, we\u2019ve added tools to detect and warn about invalid utf-8 without breaking applications. There are two sets of dynamic config settings to use.\r\n\r\nThe `sample` settings are set to a floating point value between 0.0 and 1.0 (default 0.0), and control what proportion of either RPC requests, responses, or data read from persistence, is validated for utf-8 in strings. If invalid utf-8 is found, warnings will be sent to logs, and the counter metric `utf8_validation_errors` will be incremented.\r\n\r\nThe `fail` settings (boolean, default false) control whether a validation error will be turned into a RPC failure or data corruption error.\r\n\r\n- `system.validateUTF8.sample.rpcRequest`\r\n- `system.validateUTF8.sample.rpcResponse`\r\n- `system.validateUTF8.sample.persistence`\r\n- `system.validateUTF8.fail.rpcRequest`\r\n- `system.validateUTF8.fail.rpcResponse`\r\n- `system.validateUTF8.fail.persistence`\r\n\r\nIf you think your application may be using invalid utf-8, we suggesting turning on the sample settings without the fail settings and running for a while. In a future version, validation and errors will be turned on by default (effectively sample set to 1.0 and fail set to true).\r\n\r\n### `admin-tools` docker image versioning\r\n\r\nWe separated `admin-tools` docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/admin-tools) release process. Version tag now includes versions of `tctl` (deprecated but still supported CLI) and `temporal` (modern CLI) binaries. This image is released every time whenever new version of any of these component is released. Current latest tag is [1.24.0-tctl-1.18.1-cli-0.12.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/temporalio/admin-tools/1.24.0-tctl-1.18.1-cli-0.12.0/images/sha256-a9ad0a14efb085d20ed04fc956c80af287359b20edbaa532b677c89a8b550ef2?context=explore).\r\n\r\n## Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n## Docker images for this release\r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server) (use the tag `1.24.0`)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup)) (use the tag `1.24.0`)\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools) (use the tag `1.24.0-tctl-1.18.1-cli-0.12.0`)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/compare/v1.23.1...v1.24.0\r\n"

    "body": "# Release Highlights\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n**[github.com/gogo/protobuf](http://github.com/gogo/protobuf) has been replaced with [google.golang.org/protobuf](http://google.golang.org/protobuf)**\r\n\r\nWe've fully replaced the use of gogo/protobuf with the official google protobuf runtime.  This has both developmental and operational impacts as  prior to Server version v1.23.0 our protobuf code generator allowed invalid UTF-8 data to be stored as proto strings. This isn't allowed by the proto3 spec, so if you're running a custom-built temporal server and think some tenant may store arbitrary binary data in our strings you should set `-tags protolegacy` when compiling the server. If you use our `Makefile` this is already done.\r\n\r\nIf you don't and see an error like `grpc: error unmarshalling request: string field contains invalid UTF-8` then you will need to enable this when building the server. If you're unsure then you should specify it anyways as there's no harm in doing so unless you relied on the protobuf compiler to ensure all strings were valid UTF-8.\r\n\r\nDevelopers using our protobuf-generated code will notice that:\r\n\r\n- `time.Time` in proto structs will now be `[timestamppb.Timestamp](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf@v1.31.0/types/known/timestamppb#section-documentation)`\r\n- `time.Duration` will now be `[durationpb.Duration](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/types/known/durationpb)`\r\n- V2-generated structs embed locks, so you cannot dereference them.\r\n- Proto enums will, when formatted to JSON, now be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE rather than PascalCase.\r\n    - If trying to deserialize old JSON with PascalCase to proto use `[go.temporal.io/api/temporalproto](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/api/temporalproto)`\r\n- google/protobuf objects, or objects embedding these protos, cannot be compared using `reflect.DeepEqual` or *anything* that uses it. This includes `testify` and `mock` equality testers!\r\n    - If you need `reflect.DeepEqual` for any reason you can use `go.temporal.io/api/temporalproto.DeepEqual` instead\r\n    - If you need `testify` `require`/`assert` compatible checkers you can use the `go.temporal.io/server/common/testing/protorequire`, [go.temporal.io/server/common/testing/protoassert](http://go.temporal.io/server/common/testing/protoassert) packages\r\n    - If you need matchers for gomock we have a helper under `go.temporal.io/server/common/testing/protomock`\r\n\r\n**New System Search Attributes**\r\n\r\nWe added two new system search attributes: `ParentWorkflowId` and `ParentRunId`. If you have previously created custom search attributes with one of these names, attempts to set them will start to fail. We suggest updating your workflows to not set those search attributes, delete those search attributes and then upgrade Temporal to this version. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also set the dynamic config `system.supressErrorSetSystemSearchAttribute` to true. When this dynamic config is set values for system search attributes will be ignored instead of causing your workflow to fail. Please use this as temporary workaround, because it could hide real issue in users workflows. \r\n\r\n### Schema changes\r\n\r\nBefore upgrading your Temporal Cluster to v1.23.0, you must upgrade your core and visibility schemas to the following:\r\n\r\n- Core:\r\n    - MySQL schema v1.11\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.11\r\n    - Cassandra schema v1.9\r\n- Visibility:\r\n    - Elasticsearch schema v6\r\n    - MySQL schema 1.4\r\n    - PostgreSQL schema v1.4\r\n\r\nPlease see our [upgrade\u00a0documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide#upgrade-server)\u00a0for the necessary steps to upgrade your schemas.\r\n\r\n### Deprecation Announcements\r\n\r\n- We've replaced all individual metrics describing Commands (e.g. `complete_workflow_command`, `continue_as_new_command` etc.) with a single metric called `command` which has a tag \u201ccommandType\u201d describing the specific command type (see https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4995)\r\n- Standard visibility will be deprecated in the next release v1.24.0 along with old config key names, i.e. this is the last minor version to support them. Please refer to [v1.20.0 release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.20.0) for upgrade instructions, and also refer to [v1.21.0 release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.21.0) for config key changes.\r\n- In advanced visibility, the `LIKE` operator will no longer be supported in v1.24.0. It never did what it was meant to do, and only added confusing behavior when used with Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n### Golang version\r\n\r\n- Upgraded golang to 1.21\r\n\r\n### Batch workflow reset by Build ID\r\n\r\nFor situations where an operator wants to handle a bad deployment using workflow\r\nreset, the batch reset operation can now reset to before the first workflow task\r\nprocessed by a specific build id. This is based on reset points that are created\r\nwhen build id changes between workflow tasks. Note that this also applies across\r\ncontinue-as-new.\r\n\r\nThis operation is not currently supported by a released version of the CLI, but\r\nyou can use it through the gRPC API directly, e.g. using the Go SDK:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nclient.WorkflowService().StartBatchOperationRequest(ctx, &workflowservice.StartBatchOperationRequest{\r\n\tJobId:           uuid.New(),\r\n\tNamespace:       \"my-namespace\",\r\n\t// Select workflows that were touched by a specific build id:\r\n\tVisibilityQuery: fmt.Sprintf(`BuildIds = \"unversioned:bad-build\"`),\r\n\tReason:          \"reset bad build\",\r\n\tOperation: &workflowservice.StartBatchOperationRequest_ResetOperation{\r\n\t\tResetOperation: &batch.BatchOperationReset{\r\n\t\t\tIdentity: \"bad build resetter\",\r\n\t\t\tOptions: &commonpb.ResetOptions{\r\n\t\t\t\tTarget: &commonpb.ResetOptions_BuildId{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBuildId: \"bad-build\",\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tResetReapplyType: enumspb.RESET_REAPPLY_TYPE_SIGNAL,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t},\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### History Task DLQ\r\n\r\nWe've added a DLQ to history service to handle poison pills in transfer / timer queues and other history task queues including visibility and replication queues. You can see our [operators guide](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/docs/admin/dlq.md) for more details. \r\n\r\nIf you want tasks experiencing unexpected errors to go to the DLQ after a certain number of failures you can set the `history.TaskDLQUnexpectedErrorAttempts` dynamic config.\r\n\r\n### Approximately FIFO Task Queueing\r\n\r\nOnce this feature is enabled, our task queues will be *roughly* FIFO.\r\n\r\nThis is disabled by default in 1.23, as we continue testing it but expect that it\u2019ll be enabled by default in 1.24. To enable it the following config should be set to a short duration (e.g. 5sec) from its current default value (10yrs): `\"matching.backlogNegligibleAge\"`\r\n\r\nWe've added the following metrics as part of this effort:\r\n\r\n- `poll_latency` - this is a per-task-queue histogram of the duration between worker poll request and response (with or without task) calculated from the Matching server\u2019s perspective\r\n- `task_dispatch_latency` - this is a histogram of schedule_to_start time from Matching's perspective, broken down by task queue and task source (backlog vs history)\r\n\r\n### Global Persistence Rate Limiting\r\n\r\nWe've added the ability to specify global (cluster level) rate limiting value for the persistence layer. You can configure by specifying the following dynamic config values:\r\n\r\n- `frontend.persistenceGlobalMaxQPS`\r\n- `history.persistenceGlobalMaxQPS`\r\n- `matching.persistenceGlobalMaxQPS`\r\n- `worker.persistenceGlobalMaxQPS`\r\n\r\nYou can also specify this on the per-namespace level using\r\n\r\n- `frontend.persistenceGlobalNamespaceMaxQPS`\r\n- `history.persistenceGlobalNamespaceMaxQPS`\r\n- `matching.persistenceGlobalNamespaceMaxQPS`\r\n- `worker.persistenceGlobalNamespaceMaxQPS`\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that **this functionality is experimental.** This global rate limiting isn\u2019t workload aware but shard-aware; we currently allocate this QPS to each pod based on the number of shards they own rather than the demands of the workload, so pods with many low-workload shards will have a higher allocation of this limit than pods with fewer but more active workloads. If you plan to use this you will want to set the QPS value with some headroom (like 25%) to account for this.\r\n\r\n### Renamed Deadlock-detector metrics\r\n\r\nThe metrics exported by the deadlock detector were renamed to use a `dd_` prefix to avoid confusion with other lock latency metrics. Affected metrics: `dd_cluster_metadata_lock_latency`, `dd_cluster_metadata_callback_lock_latency`, `dd_shard_controller_lock_latency`, `dd_shard_lock_latency`, `dd_namespace_registry_lock_latency`.\r\n\r\n### Visibility Prefix Search\r\n\r\nVisibility API now supports prefix search by using the keyword `STARTS_WITH`. Eg: `WorkflowType STARTS_WITH 'hello_world'`. Check the [Visibility documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/visibility#supported-operators) for additional information on supported operators.\r\n\r\n### Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n### Docker images for this release (use tag `v1.23.0`)\r\n\r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup))\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n- @evanj made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4706\r\n- @ndtretyak made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4891\r\n- @ytaben made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4880\r\n- @gallyamb made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4973\r\n- @ajayk made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/5011\r\n- @yujunz made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/5060\r\n- @denniskniep made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/5059\r\n- @tuyenpthust made their first contribution in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/5134\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/compare/v1.22.6...v1.23.0",

    "body": "# Release Highlights\r\n\r\n## Streaming for replication (WIP)\r\n\r\nThis version of server added gRPC streaming API for replications between clusters. This feature is still working in progress, is currently disabled by default. It will be enabled in future release.\r\n\r\n## Count workflow by ExecutionStatus\r\n\r\nThe Count API feature allows the user to count the number of workflow matching the given query. For example, the command `temporal workflow count -q \"WorkflowType='foo'\"` returns the number of workflows that matches `WorkflowType='foo'`.\r\n\r\nNow, you can send queries to the Count API to group by a given search attribute. Eg: `-q \"WorkflowType='foo' GROUP BY ExecutionStatus` returns the number of workflows that matches `WorkflowType='foo'` grouped by `ExecutionStatus`.\r\n\r\nThe `GROUP BY` clause is only supported in the Count API, and, at this moment, we only support grouping by `ExecutionStatus`. We plan to support group by any search attribute in a future release.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: Note: The Count API returns approximate counts.\r\n\r\n## Default authorizer changes\r\n\r\nThe default authorizer now allows `OperatorService.ListSearchAttributes` as a namespace-level read-only API. Additionally, the implementation was changed: if you have custom authorizer code based on the default authorizer, you may want to examine the new implementation.\r\n\r\n## Schedules improvements\r\n\r\nSchedules that are \u201cidle\u201d, meaning they are only configured to run for a fixed number of times (either with \u201climited actions\u201d or with a spec that doesn\u2019t match any times in the future), will now automatically be deleted after one week since their last action. This applies to existing schedules, however existing schedules that are *already* idle won\u2019t be deleted unless they\u2019re woken up by a signal.\r\n\r\nJitter is now calculated correctly so that jitter across separate schedules is not correlated. This automatically applies to existing schedules.\r\n\r\n## HTTP API\r\n\r\nThe frontend workflow service API can now exposed via HTTP in addition to the existing gRPC exposed form. The port is set on `services.frontend.rpc.httpPort` and is disabled if unset or `0`. The default Docker template enables the HTTP API on port `7243`. See the HTTP annotations on the [workflow service API proto file](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/master/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/service.proto) for more information about which operations are available at which URL paths.\r\n\r\n## All changes\r\n\r\n2023-09-05 -

    "body": "# Important\r\n\r\n### We identified a bug in this release relating to the mutable state cache, that could cause workflows to be blocked under high load. We recommend not deploying this release.\r\n\r\nIf downgrading from this release to the 1.20 series, downgrade to 1.20.4 instead of 1.20.3. This addresses an issue where the new `BuildIds` search attribute was not understood and would cause errors in visibility processing.\r\n\r\n## Schema Upgrades\r\n\r\nSee the [1.21.0 release notes](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.21.0) for schema upgrade information for upgrading to the 1.21 series.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Release Highlights\r\n\r\nThis release fixes a number of bugs:\r\n  * Workflows that use the new Workflow Update feature can be blocked with \"non deterministic\" errors under very rare circumstances.\r\n  * Introduce an option in the force-replication workflow to verify workflows were successfully replicated and applied on a target cluster.\r\n  * Fixed standby task discarding logic so that only task that does verification will be dropped.\r\n  * Changed the Elasticsearch Scan API back to use scroll if point in time is not available.\r\n  * Few other minor bugs.\r\n\r\nAnd improvements:\r\n * Change history event cache size from count-based to byte size-based to avoid caching large blob history events. The dynamic config keys `history.eventsCacheInitialSize` and `history.eventsCacheMaxSize` are changed to `history.eventsCacheInitialSizeByte` and `history.eventsCacheMaxSizeByte`, respectively.\r\n\r\n### All Changes\r\n\r\n2023-07-24 - 55c4d36f8 - Restore defaultListWorkflowsPageSize back to 1000 (from 100) (#4674)\r\n2023-07-21 - d0974cdaa - Execute VerifyReplicationTasks as an individual activity (#4656)\r\n2023-07-21 - 9f9b172f6 - Fail force-replication fast if any GenerateReplicationTasks/GenerateAndVerifyReplicationTasks activity returns error (#4642)\r\n2023-07-21 - 6247d8814 - Add verification of replication tasks in force replication (#4630)\r\n2023-07-21 - 1d5601a4b - Validate workflow task start time when complete (#4663)\r\n2023-07-21 - 655c51aad - Exclude history APIs from persistence health signals (#4637)\r\n2023-07-21 - 4edce52ec - Per shard per namespace RPS warning log (#4525)\r\n2023-07-20 - 53517fd40 - Custom search attributes validation per store (#4655)\r\n2023-07-20 - 2830f3816 - Do not use Unvailable as error type for expected error cases (#4650)\r\n2023-07-20 - a9a9acbbb - Add support for ES Scroll for Scan API (#4614)\r\n2023-07-20 - 67de6dfef - change the history cache key name to *Bytes (#4649)\r\n2023-07-20 - 268e27408 - Log when health rate limiter value changes (#4648)\r\n2023-07-20 - 32b4219ca - Better handle admin handler stream replication API lifecycle (#4647)\r\n2023-07-20 - 7a125d94e - Allow configurating history cache non-user context lock timeout (#4645)\r\n2023-07-20 - f97b681b3 - do not cache large blob history event (#4621)\r\n2023-07-20 - 49b99fe6a - Drop standby tasks in standby taks executor  (#4626)\r\n2023-07-20 - a466c4da0 - Fix metrics tagging in stream replication task processing (#4625)\r\n2023-07-20 - bcbb3b926 - Handle replicate workflow state with exist workflow data (#4617)\r\n2023-07-20 - 561495045 - properly fix migration in mem ack aggregation (#4571)\r\n2023-07-20 - 1ca8443ed - Allow context disable frontend redirection (#4547)\r\n2023-07-20 - 674657bd2 - Skip final task queue update if lost ownership (#4554)\r\n\r\nDetails about the v1.21.0 release can be found [here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.21.0).\r\n\r\n# Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n# Docker images for this release (use tag `1.21.3`)\r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup))\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools)\r\n\r\n"

There's no need to upgrade to this release from 1.20.3, but if downgrading from 1.21, the downgrade should be done to this version.\r\n\r\n### All Changes\r\n\r\n2023-07-13 - f12479619 - Add BuildIds predefined search attribute (#4624)\r\n\r\nDetails about the v1.20.0 release can be found [here](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.20.0).\r\n\r\n# Helpful links to get you started with Temporal\r\n[Temporal Docs](https://docs.temporal.io/)\r\n[Server](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal)\r\n[Docker Compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)\r\n[Helm Chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts)\r\n\r\n# Docker images for this release (use tag `1.20.4`)\r\n[Server](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/server)\r\n[Server With Auto Setup](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/auto-setup) ([what is Auto-Setup?](https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup))\r\n[Admin-Tools](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/temporalio/admin-tools)"

The release of v1.21.0 included an script to upgrade the schema, but it contains a bug. Please upgrade to [v1.21.2](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.21.2) which fixes the bug.\r\n* If downgrading from this release to the 1.20 series, downgrade to 1.20.4 instead of 1.20.3. This addresses an issue where the new `BuildIds` search attribute was not understood and would cause errors in visibility processing.\r\n\r\n## Schema Upgrades\r\n\r\nThis release requires schema upgrades for both persistence and visibility.  See the schema upgrade [documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide#upgrade-server) for the required commands for performing the upgrade.\r\n\r\n# Release Highlights\r\n\r\n## Worker Versioning (preview)\r\n\r\nLinks to docs:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.temporal.io/workers#worker-versioning\r\n- https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/java/versioning#worker-versioning\r\n- https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/golang/versioning#worker-versioning\r\n\r\nDescription: Worker Versioning simplifies the process of deploying changes to Workflow Definitions.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f This feature requires Advanced Visibility\r\n\r\nIn the SDK, a user can identify a Worker with a Build ID, which should be associated at build time, and configure that Worker to use Versioning.\r\n\r\nAn operator can use the `UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility` gRPC API (and the high-level APIs in the SDKs) to define which builds are compatible with each other and control task routing for existing and new Workflows based on the compatibility constraints.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, operators and automated scripts can use the `GetWorkerTaskReachability` API to query for build IDs that are no longer reachable and whose associated workers can be retired.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f To enable worker versioning, turn on the `frontend.workerVersioningDataAPIs,` `frontend.workerVersioningWorkflowAPIs`, and `worker.buildIdScavengerEnabled` dynamic config flags (disabled by default in this release).\r\n\r\nThis feature introduces a couple of schema changes:\r\n\r\n1. A new `BuildIds` Search Attribute that is used to track reachability. This new Search Attribute requires a Visibility schema update. See the schema upgrade [documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide#upgrade-server) for the required commands for performing the upgrade.\r\n2. A new `task_queue_user_data` table, which stores the Versioning data for the various Task Queues and is replicated using the Namespace replication queue. See the schema upgrade [documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide#upgrade-server) for the required commands for performing the upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe Matching Service will now load Task Queue user data from persistence for the Task Queue root partition, and non-root partitions will try to obtain and maintain a fresh view of the user data by long-polling other Task Queue partitions for the same Task Queue.\r\n\r\nIf user data loading is suspected to be causing processing overhead, it can be completely disabled by using the `matching.loadUserData` dynamic config flag.\r\n\r\nNote that disabling the loading of user data will essentially disable the Versioning feature and will cause tasks for versioned Workflows to be dropped by the Matching Service, causing versioned Workflows to be stuck. This approach was chosen over dispatching versioned Workflows to arbitrary Workers and breaking the user-defined compatibility semantics. Manual intervention will be required to regenerate Tasks for stuck versioned Workflows.\r\n\r\nAs part of this work, the `UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatiblity`, `UpdateNamespace`, and `RegisterNamespace` APIs now have stricter rate limiting because they can produce replication messages for Global Namespaces. The Namespace replication queue is a critical resource that is not partitioned and serves as a mechanism for delivering failover messages between Clusters.\r\n\r\nA few more dynamic configuration options were added for this feature:\r\n\r\n- `limit.workerBuildIdSize` is the byte length limit for a Worker Build ID as used in the RPC methods for updating the version sets for a Task Queue. Do not set this option to a value greater than 255 for Clusters that use SQL-based persistence due to predefined VARCHAR column width.\r\n- `limit.versionCompatibleSetLimitPerQueue` is the maximum number of compatible sets allowed in the Versioning data for a Task Queue. Update requests that would cause the Versioning data to exceed this number will fail with a `FailedPrecondition` error.\r\n- `limit.versionBuildIdLimitPerQueue` is the maximum number of Build IDs allowed to be defined in the Versioning data for a Task Queue. Update requests that would cause the Versioning data to exceed this number will fail with a `FailedPrecondition` error.\r\n- `limit.taskQueuesPerBuildId` limits the number of Task Queue names that can be mapped to a single Build ID.\r\n- `limit.reachabilityTaskQueueScan` limits the number of Task Queues to scan when responding to a `GetWorkerTaskReachability` query.\r\n- `limit.reachabilityQueryBuildIds` limits the number of Build IDs that can be requested in a single call to the `GetWorkerTaskReachability` API.\r\n- `worker.removableBuildIdDurationSinceDefault` is the minimum duration since a Build ID was last set as default in its containing set for it to be considered for removal. The value is used by the Build ID scavenger.\r\n- `frontend.rps.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs` limits the requests-per-second (RPS) rate for Namespace replication-inducing APIs (such as `RegisterNamespace`, `UpdateNamespace`, and `UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`). This config is EXPERIMENTAL and might be changed or removed in a later release.\r\n- `frontend.namespaceRPS.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs` is a per-host and per-Namespace RPS limit for Namespace replication-including APIs (such as `RegisterNamespace`, `UpdateNamespace`, and `UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`). This config is EXPERIMENTAL and might be changed or removed in a later release.\r\n- `frontend.namespaceBurst.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs` is a per-host and per-Namespace burst limit for Namespace replication-inducing APIs (such as `RegisterNamespace`, `UpdateNamespace`, and `UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`). This config is EXPERIMENTAL and might be changed or removed in a later release.\r\n- `frontend.globalNamespaceRPS.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs` is a Cluster global, per-Namespace RPS limit for Namespace replication-inducing APIs (such as `RegisterNamespace`, `UpdateNamespace`, and `UpdateWorkerBuildIdCompatibility`). The limit is evenly distributed among available Frontend Service instances. If this option is set, it overwrites the per-instance limit configured with `frontend.namespaceRPS.namespaceReplicationInducingAPIs`. This config is EXPERIMENTAL and might be changed or removed in a later release.\r\n\r\n## Synchronous Update (preview)\r\n\r\nSynchronous Workflow Update enables a gRPC client of a Workflow Execution to issue requests to that Workflow Execution and receive a response. These requests are delivered to and processed by a client-specified Workflow Execution. Updates are differentiated from Queries in that the processing of an Update is allowed to modify the state of a Workflow Execution. Updates are different from Signals in that an Update returns a response.\r\n\r\nUpdates can be handled by Workflows written using the latest Go and Java SDKs, with other languages to follow.\r\n\r\nAny gRPC client can invoke Updates via the `WorkflowService.UpdateWorkflowExecution` API, which returns the Update outcome inline. Additionally, past Update outcomes can be observed via the `WorkflowService.PollWorkflowExecutionUpdate` API.\r\n\r\nUpdate functionality is disabled by default but can be enabled per Namespace by setting the `frontend.enableUpdateWorkflowExecution` flag to `true` for that Namespace in dynamic config.\r\n\r\nIn this release, Update outcomes are stored for the same period as the Workflow history itself and can be observed for as long as that history exists. The execution and retention of Updates is configured via two optional dynamic configuration values:\r\n\r\n- `history.maxTotalUpdates` controls the total number of Updates that a single Workflow Execution can support. The default is 2000.\r\n- `history.maxInFlightUpdates` controls the number of Updates that can be \u201cin-flight\u201d (that is, concurrently executing, not having completed) for a given Workflow Execution. The default is 10.\r\n\r\nWarning: when resolving history event conflict in global namespace, history event for update may be lost. This will be addressed in future release. \r\n\r\n## Batch Reset via BatchOperation API\r\n\r\nDescription: The server now supports resetting a batch of Workflow Executions. `StartBatchOperationRequest` now supports the  `Operation` type of `ResetOperation`.\r\n\r\nThis operation depends on two additional parameters:\r\n\r\n- `ResetReapplyType`: Determines whether to reapply Signals after resetting the Workflow.\r\n- `ResetType`: Determines which Event ID to choose when resetting the batch of Workflows.\r\n    - `RESET_TYPE_FIRST_WORKFLOW_TASK`: Resets to the Event of the first Workflow Task completed. If the Task doesn\u2019t exist, resets to the Event after the Task was scheduled.\r\n    - `RESET_TYPE_LAST_WORKFLOW_TASK` : Resets to the Event of the last Workflow Task completed. If the Task doesn\u2019t exist, resets to the Event after the Task was scheduled.\r\n\r\n## Dynamic rate limiter\r\n\r\nThe dynamic rate limiter is an advanced system-protection mechanism. By default, it\u2019s disabled. When enabled, the per-host persistence rate limiter automatically adjust based on the average number of errors returned from persistence and the average latency of persistence requests.\r\n\r\nThe rate limit is adjusted using a multiplier between 0.1 and 1.0 (default 1.0) on the host-level persistence rate limiter. If either the ratio of persistence calls that result in an error or the average latency of persistence requests exceeds their respective thresholds, the multiplier is reduced. If the multiplier is less than its maximum (1.0) and neither threshold is exceeded, the multiplier is increased.\r\n\r\nSeveral new dynamic config options are available to tune these adjustments. They are grouped in a map for each service, with the key `<service>.persistenceDynamicRateLimitingParams`, but currently only apply to the History Service.\r\n\r\n- `enabled`: Whether dynamic rate limiting is enabled for this service (default `false`).\r\n- `refreshInterval`: How often the rate limit multiplier and dynamic config options are updated (default 10s).\r\n- `latencyThreshold`: The limit for average latency that should trigger a rate limit reduction when exceeded (default 0.0; not used).\r\n- `errorThreshold`: The ratio of errors to total requests that should trigger a rate limit reduction when exceeded (should be between 0 and 1; default 0.0; not used).\r\n- `rateBackoffStepSize`: The amount the rate limiter multiplier is reduced when either limit is exceeded (should be between 0 and 1; default 0.3).\r\n- `rateIncreaseStepSize`: The amount the rate limiter multiplier is increased when neither threshold is exceeded and the multiplier is less than its maximum (should be between 0 and 1; default 0.1).\r\n\r\n## Updated defaultAuthorizer and defaultJWTClaimMapper\r\n\r\nImportant: If you use defaultAuthorizer or defaultJWTClaimMapper, this is a breaking change. You need to update your JWT generator to produce permission for the system-level role as \u201ctemporal-system:*role*\u201d instead of \u201csystem:*role*\u201d, where *role* is read, write, admin, or worker. For safe rollout, you can add \u201ctemporal-system:*role*\u201d to the list of permissions before rollout and remove \u201csystem:*role*\u201d after rollout is done.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4227 https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4244\r\n\r\nNote that defaultAuthorizer and defaultJWTClaimMapper are not used by default. You must explicitly configure it to use them.\r\n\r\n- Remove access to AdminService and OperatorService APIs from System RoleWriter.\r\n- Remove the Namespace lowercase change. Admins of Namespace \u201cFoo\u201d will not have access to namespace \u201cfoo\u201d.\r\n- Previously, the defaultJWTClaimMapper treated \u201csystem\u201d as a special Namespace, and granted system-level access to the admin of the Namespace named \u201csystem\u201d. This is now changed to use \u201ctemporal-system\u201d, which is a real system Namespace. Roles on the \u201ctemporal-system\u201d Namespace will have system-level access.\r\n\r\n## Visibility\r\n\r\n### Deprecation heads up\r\n\r\n- Standard Visibility is entering a deprecation process. We are marking it deprecated with this version (1.21), and we expect to remove it in v1.23.0. If you are using Cassandra as your Visibility store, check the deprecation warning below. If you use Standard Visibility with a SQL database, see the [v1.20.0 release highlights](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.20.0) for details about upgrading to Advanced Visibility. If you want to migrate to a different Visibility store, see [Visibility store](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store).\r\n- Cassandra, as a Visibility store, will be deprecated together with Standard Visibility. Please migrate away from using Cassandra as your Visibility store. For migration information, see [Visibility store](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store).\r\n- Docs links:\r\n    - [Concept - Visibility](https://docs.temporal.io/visibility)\r\n    - [Cluster Deployment - Visibility store configuration](https://docs.temporal.io/cluster-deployment-guide#visibility-store)\r\n\r\n### Configs\r\n\r\nSome Visibility configs have changed. The following lists all the changes, and all the old keys will be removed in the next release.\r\n\r\nFor the Server config\r\n\r\n- Configure Elasticsearch as a Visibility store\r\n    - New key: `visibilityStore`\r\n    - Old key: `advancedVisibilityStore`\r\n\r\nFor dynamic configs\r\n\r\n- Enable reading from secondary Visibility\r\n    - New key: `system.enableReadFromSecondaryVisibility`\r\n    - Old keys: `system.enableReadVisibilityFromES` / `system.enableReadFromSecondaryAdvancedVisibility`\r\n- Secondary Visibility writing mode\r\n    - New key: `system.secondaryVisibilityWritingMode`\r\n    - Old keys: `system.enableWriteToSecondaryAdvancedVisibility` / `system.advancedVisibilityWritingMode`\r\n- Visibility maximum read QPS\r\n    - New key: `system.visibilityPersistenceMaxReadQPS`\r\n    - Old keys: `system.standardVisibilityPersistenceMaxReadQPS` / `system.advancedVisibilityPersistenceMaxReadQPS`\r\n- Visibility maximum write QPS\r\n    - New key: `system.visibilityPersistenceMaxWriteQPS`\r\n    - Old keys: `system.standardVisibilityPersistenceMaxWriteQPS` / `system.advancedVisibilityPersistenceMaxWriteQPS`\r\n\r\n### List and Scan APIs\r\n\r\nThe List and Scan APIs have the following changes.\r\n\r\n- For List and Scan API, the default maximum page size is reduced from 10000 to 1000. If you call with a larger number, it will cap at 1000, and it will not throw an error. As for pagination, as long as you get a non-null token, there might be a next page: a page with less than 1000 does not necessarily mean that it\u2019s the last page. The maximum page size can be changed using the dynamic config `frontend.visibilityMaxPageSize`; the dynamic config `frontend.esIndexMaxResultWindow` has been removed.\r\n- The Scan API, even though its documentation says that the result set is not guaranteed to be sorted, is used to support the `ORDER BY` clause, and it had a default order. With this release, the `ORDER BY` clause is no longer supported. For Elasticsearch, it has been optimized for faster scanning without guaranteeing order.\r\n- ~When using Elasticsearch, the Scan API is used to do a [scroll](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/scroll-api.html) search or open a [point in time](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/point-in-time-api.html) search if available. Now, it supports only point in time searches, as supported by Elasticsearch 7.10 and later. Currently, we do not support OpenSearch, and the Scan API won\u2019t work with OpenSearch.~ **[Update 7/24/2023: this was reverted in [v1.21.3](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/releases/tag/v1.21.3)]**\r\n- Support for the `ORDER BY` clause is now disabled by default. You can enable it by setting the dynamic config `system.visibilityDisableOrderByClause` to `false`, and it can be set per Namespace. Although you can still enable it, this feature will likely be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n## Frontend Service shutdown behavior\r\n\r\nDescription: The shutdown procedure for the Frontend Service has been changed slightly to work better with load balancers.\r\n\r\n- First, the Frontend Service returns `NOT_SERVING` to gRPC health checks for the duration of the dynamic config `frontend.shutdownFailHealthCheckDuration` (default 0 seconds).\r\n- Second, the Frontend Service tells gRPC to stop accepting new connections and RPCs. Currently running RPCs (including long polls) will not be interrupted yet.\r\n- After the value of the dynamic config `frontend.shutdownDrainDuration` (default 1 second), currently running RPCs will be canceled.\r\n- The sum of the two durations is limited to 300s. After that time, the process exits.\r\n\r\nThe default maximum long-poll duration is 60s. To avoid any client errors, we recommend setting `frontend.shutdownDrainDuration` to at least the 60s and setting `frontend.shutdownFailHealthCheckDuration` to at least as long as it takes your health checking system to notice the failed health check and stop sending traffic to that Frontend Service.\r\n\r\nTemporal SDKs expect errors and retry intelligently, so these settings are not required for the correct execution of Workflow.\r\n\r\n(The previous behavior had incoming RPCs during the drain interval return an application-level \u201cShutting down\u201d error instead of a gRPC-level error. Also, the sum of the two durations was limited to 120s.)\r\n\r\n## Dynamic config validation\r\n\r\nDescription: For dynamic config values that are interpreted as durations, previously, an integer value (that is, with no unit specified) would be treated as an error, and the default value would be used instead. Now integers are treated as seconds. (Floats are still not allowed.)\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s highly recommended to use values with units for clarity. If using the default YAML-based dynamic config, use strings like `\"30s\"` or `\"5m\"` instead of `30` and `300`. If using a custom dynamic config implementation, ensure that values are returned with the Go type `time.Duration`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, dynamic config values that fail to parse are logged at warning level. (After some amount of them, they\u2019re logged only sporadically).\r\n\r\n## Per workflow limit\r\n\r\nRelated PR: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/4326\r\n\r\nDescription: The default values for various per-Workflow limits have been reduced or tightened. More specifically:\r\n\r\n- `limit.numPendingChildExecutions.error`, `limit.numPendingActivities.error`, `limit.numPendingSignals.error`, and `limit.numPendingCancelRequests.error` have been reduced to 2000. If exceeded, Workflow Tasks that generate new Child Workflows or Activities, signal external Workflows, or request cancellation of external Workflow Commands will fail. Be aware that there\u2019s no partial acceptance of Workflow Commands. As a result, if Commands in a single Workflow Task response exceed those limits, the Workflow Task will keep failing.\r\n- `history.maximumSignalsPerExecution` is now 10,000. If exceeded, new Signal requests sent to the Workflow are rejected and return an `InvalidArgument` error.\r\n\r\n## All changes\r\n\r\n2023-06-23 - 521641f62 - Update updateRegistry store on mutable state reload (#4532)\r\n2023-06-22 -
