    "body": "This is a bug fix release for various issues discovered after we released 0.10.2. There are no new major features, just bug fixes. Database files created by DuckDB v0.10.* or v0.9.* can be read by DuckDB v0.10.3.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\nEven though this is \"only\" a bug fix release, there have been some major areas of work that warrant a separate mention:\r\n- We have added a feature to update extensions using the `UPDATE EXTENSIONS` syntax #11677\r\n- There have been some serious internal improvements around **checkpointing**, most notably, checkpoints can run while other connections are reading, and no longer block new connections while checkpointing #11918. Also, `FORCE CHECKPOINT`  no longer actively cancels transactions, it now waits until it can checkpoint #12061\r\n- DuckDB now has native support to load data from HuggingFace using the `hf://` prefix #11831\r\n- We have slightly changed `NULL` casting behaviour with the `MAP` type #11745\r\n- The Java JDBC driver has been moved to its own repo: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-java #11873\r\n- DuckDB now cleanly compiles with `-Wconversion` and all conversions are actually being checked #11716, #11673 \r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Add setting to control the maximum swap space by @Tishj in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/10978\r\n* [Python][Dev] Dynamically generate the Connection wrapper methods by @Tishj in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11202\r\n* Fixes duckdb wasm by @carlopi in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11688\r\n* Checked conversions between signed and unsigned integers by @hannes in https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/11673\r\n* Bump Julia to

    "body": "This preview release of DuckDB is named \"Fulvigula\" after the [Mottled duck (Anas fulvigula)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mottled_duck) which lives in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is apparently highly prized amongst (heartless) hunters. \r\n\r\nThere are **two SQL-level breaking changes** in this release: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/7174 The default sort order switched from `NULLS FIRST` to `NULLS LAST` because this is more intuitive, especially in conjunction with `LIMIT`. \r\n- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/7082 The division operator `/` will now always lead to a floating point result even with integer parameters. The new operator `//` retains the old semantics. This change is consistent with Python. \r\n\r\nNote: Again, this release introduces a backwards-incompatible change to the on-disk storage format. We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Issue 5984 #4 LogicalColumnIndex out of range Error by @Tmonster in

    "body": "This preview release of DuckDB is named \"Ferruginea\" after the [Andean Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_duck).\r\n\r\nBinary builds are listed below. Feedback is very welcome.\r\n\r\nNote: This release should be backwards-compatible wrt the on-disk storage format, but the next release may very well be incompatible again. So please don't rely on this just yet.  We suggest you use the `EXPORT DATABASE` command with the old version followed by `IMPORT DATABASE` with the new version to migrate your data. See the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/export) for details.\r\n\r\nAlso note: DuckDB is switching to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
