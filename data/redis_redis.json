Both Alpine and Debian Docker images are now available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis). Snap and Homebrew distributions are available as well (see https://github.com/redis/homebrew-redis)\r\n\r\n### Security fixes\r\n\r\n- (CVE-2024-46981) Lua script may lead to remote code execution\r\n- (CVE-2024-51741) Denial-of-service due to malformed ACL selectors\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- #13695 New I/O threading implementation \r\n- #13732 New replication mechanism\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- #13653 `MODULE LOADEX` - crash on nonexistent parameter name\r\n- #13661 `FUNCTION FLUSH` - memory leak when using jemalloc\r\n- #13626 Memory leak on failed RDB loading\r\n\r\n### Other general improvements\r\n\r\n- #13639 When `hide-user-data-from-log` is enabled - also print command tokens on crash\r\n- #13660 Add the Lua VM memory to memory overhead\r\n\r\n### New metrics\r\n\r\n- #13592 `INFO` - new `KEYSIZES` section includes key size distributions for basic data types\r\n- #13695 `INFO` - new `Threads` section includes I/O threading metrics\r\n\r\n### Modules API\r\n\r\n- #13666 `RedisModule_ACLCheckKeyPrefixPermissions` - check access permissions to any key matching a given prefix\r\n- #13676 `RedisModule_HashFieldMinExpire` - query the minimum expiration time over all the hash\u2019s fields\r\n- #13676 `RedisModule_HashGet` - new `REDISMODULE_HASH_EXPIRE_TIME` flag - query the field expiration time\r\n- #13656 `RedisModule_RegisterXXXConfig` - allow registering unprefixed configuration parameters\r\n\r\n### Configuration parameters\r\n\r\n- `replica-full-sync-buffer-limit` - maximum size of accumulated replication stream data on the replica side\r\n- `io-threads-do-reads` is no longer effective. The new I/O threading implementation always use threads for both reads and writes\r\n\r\n### Performance and resource utilization improvements\r\n\r\n- #13638 Optimize CRC64 performance\r\n- #13521 Optimize commands with large argument count - reuse c->argv after command execution\r\n- #13558 Optimize `PFCOUNT` and `PFMERGE` - SIMD acceleration\r\n- #13644 Optimize `GET` on high pipeline use-cases\r\n- #13646 Optimize `EXISTS` - prefetching and branch prediction hints\r\n- #13652 Optimize `LRANGE` - improve listpack handling and decoding efficiency\r\n- #13655 Optimize `HSET` - avoid unnecessary hash field creation or deletion\r\n- #13721 Optimize `LRANGE` and `HGETALL` - refactor client write preparation and handling\r\n\r\n### Known bugs and limitations\r\n\r\n- Query Engine - config params access via CONFIG SET/GET are disabled\r\n- Missing support for `FILTER` and `GEOFILTER` in `FT.SEARCH`\r\n",
