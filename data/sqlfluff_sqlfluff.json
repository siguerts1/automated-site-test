    "body": "## Highlights\r\n\r\nThis release brings a few more significant changes. Especially given the introduction of several new rules, we highly recommend testing this release on your project before upgrading to make sure they are configured appropriately for your project style guide. As always, we have tried to make sure that the defaults for all new rules are both widely applicable, and fairly light touch. While all have been tested on some existing larger codebases which the maintainers have access to - do still report any bugs you might find on GitHub in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n* We've dropped the `appdirs` package as a dependency (as an abandoned project) and instead added `platformdirs` instead. Users should not notice any functionality changes beyond the different dependency.\r\n* *TWO* new dialects: _Impala_ and _StarRocks_.\r\n* *FIVE* new rules:\r\n  * `AM08` (`ambiguous.join_condition`), which detects `JOIN` clauses without conditions (i.e. without an `ON` or `USING` clause). These are often typos and can result in significant row count increases if unintended.\r\n  * `CV12` (`convention.join_condition`), which is related to `AM08` and detects cases where users have used a `WHERE` clause instead of a `JOIN ... ON ...` clause to do their join conditions. The join condition is a form of metadata and should communicate to the end user how the table should be joined. By mixing this information into the `WHERE` clause it makes the SQL harder to understand.\r\n  * `LT14` (`layout.keyword_newline`), which allows certain keywords to trigger line breaks in queries. Primarily this forces the main `SELECT` statement clauses like `WHERE`, `GROUP BY` etc. onto new lines. This rule has been designed to be highly configurable, but with sensible light-touch defaults. Check out the docs to adapt it to the conventions of your project.\r\n  * `ST10` (`structure.constant_expression`), some SQL users include redundant expressions in their code (e.g. `WHERE tbl.col = tbl.col`). These conditions always evaluate to a constant outcome (i.e. always evaluate as `TRUE` or `FALSE`) as so add no functionality or meaning to the query. This rule catches them.\r\n  * `ST11` (`structure.unused_join`), which detects unused joins in SQL statements, and is designed to catch tables that were once used, but where the column references have since been removed and now the table is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBeyond these changes, we've seen a whole host of dialect improvements to almost *all* of the supported dialects and several bugfixes which are combined into this release.\r\n\r\nWe also welcome **TWELVE** new contributors to the project in this release. Thanks to all of them for their hard work \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude80.\r\n\r\n## What\u2019s Changed\r\n\r\n* New Rule LT14: Keyword line positioning (#6213) @keraion\r\n* New Rule ST11: Detect unused tables in join (#5266) @danparizher\r\n* Snowflake Create Table allow inline foreign key with on delete \u2026 (#6486) @WobblyRobbly\r\n* Fix minor linting error in CI (#6483) @alanmcruickshank\r\n* Snowflake: alter table on delete and update support (#6473) @WobblyRobbly\r\n* New Rules AM08 + CV12: Detect implicit cross joins (#6239) @rogalski\r\n* New Rule ST10: const expression checker (#6392) @rogalski\r\n* DuckDB: Support MAP data type (#6478) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* Hive: Add 'ALTER VIEW' query grammar (#6479) @mrebaker\r\n* Standardise json operator spacing between dialects (#6447) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* fixes #6463: Set Variable Parsing for SparkSQL and Databricks (#6464) @fstg1992\r\n* Teradata: support REPLACE VIEW and LOCKING ...

    "body": "## Highlights\r\n\r\nThis release brings a few minor breaking changes, both for the core project and for the dbt templater. For the main project:\r\n\r\n* Resolving an issue with the spacing of functions (LT01), which involved a change to how functions are parsed. If your project relies on the specific parsing of functions, the bracketed arguments are now wrapped in a `function_contents` object. We recommend that you examine the new parsing structure using this new release in testing first.\r\n\r\n* `RF06` (`references.quoting`) is now case sensitive when removing quotes which are detected as unnecessary. This rule has also been re-enabled by default for Snowflake and Postgres where it had previously been disabled (for the reason that in the past it hadn't been appropriately case sensitive). Treatment for totally case-insensitive dialects like DuckDB and SparkSQL have also been included. Please check the new documentation for this rule (which is much more explicit now), for details related to your dialect.\r\n\r\n* Patterns equivalent to those from `.sqlfluffignore` can now be included in `.sqlfluff` and `pyproject.toml` files.\r\n\r\n* Using the `python` templater, users now have an option to include variables which include a dot in the path, like `{{ foo.bar }}` using a special `sqlfluff` context variable.\r\n\r\n* Significant changes under the hood to the handling of configuration files. Most of these should not be visible to end users, but for anyone integrating SQLFluff into a larger project and relying on native file loading may need to refactor their project for this release. Most notably here, for maintainers of plugins, the `ConfigLoader` class has been deprecated, and plugins should instead call the config loading functions directly. See the example plugin for details.\r\n\r\n* Documentation, especially for dialects, has been significantly improved. Documentation for `CP02` (`capitalisation.identifiers`) has also been clarified to make it's implication for references and aliases more clear.\r\n\r\n* During testing, to isolate the effect of specific rules, there's a new CLI option `--disable-noqa-except` which allows all `noqa` options to be ignored _except_ the ones provided in this option.\r\n\r\nFor the dbt templater:\r\n\r\n* Support for dbt 1.1-1.3 has been removed. All have been in End of Life (EOL) support by dbtlabs for almost two years. They are also poorly supported by other projects and tools.\r\n\r\n* The dbt templater has been migrated to use `pyproject.toml`.\r\n\r\n* Handling of errors and exceptions raised within dbt has had an overhaul. Users may see a slightly different presentation of errors, but the overall stability should be more robust.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those changes, there have been too many dialect contributions and bugfixes  to mention specifically. We've also seen **six** people make their first contributions to the project as part of preparing for this release! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89.\r\n\r\n## What\u2019s Changed\r\n\r\n* Handle multi-processing dbt exceptions much better.

    "body": "## Highlights\r\n\r\nThis minor release has two breaking changes:\r\n - The addition of camelCase in the extended capitalisation policy. This change removes the ability to\r\nautodetect PascalCase, from now on PascalCase, and camelCase must be explicitly set in the config if desired.\r\n - The detection method for sqlfluff config has changed. It should now be more consistent, regardless of how deep if the directory\r\nstructure you run the command from.\r\n\r\nThis release also brings in support for the MariaDB dialect. As well as this, there are many bugfixes,\r\nand dialect improvements.\r\n\r\nThanks also to the **twelve** new contributors whose work was included\r\nin this release!

    "body": "## Highlights\r\n\r\nThis release brings several breaking changes to previous releases. Most notably:\r\n\r\n* It drops support for python 3.7, which reached end of life in June 2023.\r\n\r\n* It migrates to `pyproject.toml` rather than `setup.cfg` as the python packaging configuration file (although keeping `setuptools` as the default backend).\r\n\r\n* The serialised output for `sqlfluff lint` (and the corresponding API methods) now contains more information about the span of linting issues, initial proposed fixes and several statistics which were previously only accessible via csv export. Beside the *new* fields, the original fields of `line_pos` and `line_no` have been renamed to `start_line_pos` and `start_line_no`, to distinguish them from the new fields starting `end_*`.\r\n\r\n* The default `annotation_level` set by the `--annotation-level` option on the `sqlfluff lint` command has been changed from `notice` to `warning`, to better distinguish linting errors from warnings, which always now have the level of `notice`. This is only relevant when using the `github-annotation` or `github-annotation-native` formats.\r\n\r\n* A change in the default behaviour for `convention.not_equals`. The new default is to be `consistent`, which is slightly more relaxed than the original behaviour.\r\n\r\n* The `--force` option has been deprecated on `sqlfluff fix` as that option is now the default behaviour. This is to enable significant reductions in memory overhead when linting large projects.\r\n\r\n* The long since deprecated `--disable_progress_bar` option has been removed (which was replaced by the kabab-case `--disable-progress-bar` more than a year ago).\r\n\r\n* Plugins are now loaded progressively, and with error handling. If a plugin fails to load, SQLFluff will now continue onward and try to run regardless while also showing a more helpful error message.\r\n\r\nOn top of these changes, there have a been a whole host of dialect improvements and additions, in particular the inclusion of a`vertica` dialect for the first time. There's also:\r\n\r\n* A new rule (`aliasing.self_alias.column`) which prevents aliasing a column as itself.\r\n\r\n* A change to disables AL01 (`aliasing.table`) by default for Oracle.\r\n\r\n* A change to allow AL05 to allow aliasing for a `VALUES` clause.\r\n\r\nFor more specifics please take a look at the [release notes](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/latest/releasenotes.html).\r\n\r\nThanks to the community for patience during the release cycle for 3.0.0, which has taken a little longer than expected. Thanks also to the **TWENTY SEVEN** new contributors whose changes are included in this release. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n## What\u2019s Changed\r\n\r\n* Progressively load plugins [#5661](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5661) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Postgres: AL05, ignore aliases in values clause [#5669](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5669) [@keraion](https://github.com/keraion)\r\n* Add Postgres CREATE FOREIGN TABLE statement [#5657](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5657) [@edpft](https://github.com/edpft)\r\n* Lexer: Handle escaped curly brace slices from the python templater [#5666](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5666) [@keraion](https://github.com/keraion)\r\n* [CI]: Update pre-commit hook versions [#5665](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5665) [@keraion](https://github.com/keraion)\r\n* Resolves #5624: Snowflake unparsable unset table options [#5664](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5664) [@andychannery](https://github.com/andychannery)\r\n* Revert Ruff Changes [#5662](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5662) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Complete the memory overhead work on cli fix [#5653](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5653) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Resolve #5647: Snowflake unparsable variant access after cast [#5658](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5658) [@andychannery](https://github.com/andychannery)\r\n* BQ PK and FK [#5654](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5654) [@OTooleMichael](https://github.com/OTooleMichael)\r\n* Prep version 3.0.0a6 [#5652](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5652) [@github-actions](https://github.com/github-actions)\r\n* Add Support for Databricks `CREATE FUNCTION` Syntax in SparkSQL Parser [#5615](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5615) [@mitchellvanrijkom](https://github.com/mitchellvanrijkom)\r\n* Swap fix `--force` for `--check` [#5650](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5650) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Remove `DeprecatedOption` [#5649](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5649) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Resolve broken loop limit test [#5651](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5651) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Snowflake: Move NOTIFY to non-reserved words [#5645](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5645) [@greg-finley](https://github.com/greg-finley)\r\n* BigQuery: GROUP BY ALL [#5646](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5646) [@greg-finley](https://github.com/greg-finley)\r\n* chore: use pre-calculated `_code_indices` in `BaseSegment::raw_segmen\u2026 [#5644](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5644) [@gvozdvmozgu](https://github.com/gvozdvmozgu)\r\n* Fix Snowflake Semistructured identifier parsing regex-expression [#5635](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5635) [@DannyMor](https://github.com/DannyMor)\r\n* Postgres: Update ReferentialActionGrammar to support sets of columns [#5628](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5628) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* Snowflake: Add syntax for masking policy force [#5629](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5629) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* Postgres: Allow nested block comments [#5630](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5630) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* Postgres: Add Create, Alter, Drop Statistics [#5631](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5631) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* T-SQL Fix relative sql filepath lexer [#5632](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5632) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* Tech Debt: Replace some sequences with their Ref equivalents [#5633](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5633) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* ANSI/MYSQL: Support Create Role If Not Exists [#5634](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5634) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* Add Vertica dialect [#5640](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5640) [@PolitePp](https://github.com/PolitePp)\r\n* Add Support for Snowflake Materialised View and Column Masking Policy [#5637](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5637) [@ulixius9](https://github.com/ulixius9)\r\n* [snowflake dialect] support ALTER TABLE ...

As part of that we've also deprecated the `--force` option on `sqlfluff fix` and made that the default behaviour (the associated memory optimisations will come shortly).\r\n\r\nThis also removes the long since deprecated `--disable_progress_bar` option (which was replaced by the kabab-case `--disable-progress -bar` more than a year ago).\r\n\r\nOn top of that this release also introduces the `vertica` dialect for the first time, and a whole host of bugfixes and improvements to other dialects.\r\n\r\nThis release should be considered a release candidate for the final `3.0.0` release which will follow shortly in the next few days unless any other major issues are found.\r\n\r\nThanks particularly to the **seven** new contributors we saw in this release \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89.\r\n\r\n## What\u2019s Changed\r\n\r\n* Add Support for Databricks `CREATE FUNCTION` Syntax in SparkSQL Parser (#5615) @mitchellvanrijkom\r\n* Swap fix `--force` for `--check` (#5650) @alanmcruickshank\r\n* Remove `DeprecatedOption` (#5649) @alanmcruickshank\r\n* Resolve broken loop limit test (#5651) @alanmcruickshank\r\n* Snowflake: Move NOTIFY to non-reserved words (#5645) @greg-finley\r\n* BigQuery: GROUP BY ALL (#5646) @greg-finley\r\n* chore: use pre-calculated `_code_indices` in `BaseSegment::raw_segmen\u2026 (#5644) @gvozdvmozgu\r\n* Fix Snowflake Semistructured identifier parsing regex-expression (#5635) @DannyMor\r\n* Postgres: Update ReferentialActionGrammar to support sets of columns (#5628) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* Snowflake: Add syntax for masking policy force (#5629) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* Postgres: Allow nested block comments (#5630) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* Postgres: Add Create, Alter, Drop Statistics (#5631) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* T-SQL Fix relative sql filepath lexer (#5632) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* Tech Debt: Replace some sequences with their Ref equivalents (#5633) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* ANSI/MYSQL: Support Create Role If Not Exists (#5634) @WittierDinosaur\r\n* Add Vertica dialect (#5640) @PolitePp\r\n* Add Support for Snowflake Materialised View and Column Masking Policy (#5637) @ulixius9\r\n* [snowflake dialect] support ALTER TABLE ...

Notably also:\r\n\r\n* A change in the default behaviour for `convention.not_equals`. The new default is to be `consistent`, which is slightly more relaxed than the original behaviour.\r\n* A new rule (`aliasing.self_alias.column`) which prevents aliasing a column as itself.\r\n* Disables `AL01` (`aliasing.table`) by default for Oracle.\r\n\r\nThis release also saw **ELEVEN** new contributors in this release \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89.

If your use case depends on some of the internals of SQLFluff, you may find some breaking changes. The bigger changes are:\r\n\r\n- Python 3.12 support is now official (although older releases may also work as only a few changes were required for full 3.12 support).\r\n- We've done a significant re-write of the parsing engine to remove some unnecessary segment manipulation and get us closer to \"single pass\" parsing. This changes the internal API being used on any `.match()` methods, and also removes the `parse_grammar` attribute on any dialect segments. We are not aware of any 3rd party libraries which rely on these APIs however and so have not triggered a more major release. These lead to significant performance improvements during parsing.\r\n- Standardisation of terminators in the parser, and the introduction of the `ParseMode` option has enabled the removal of the `StartsWith`, `GreedyUntil` and `EphemeralSegment` parser classes.\r\n- Several validation checks have been revised in this release, which should both improve performance (by reducing duplication), but also be more effective in preventing the application of any fixes which would result in unparsable files.\r\n\r\nAlongside the big things this also includes a host of bugfixes, dialect improvements and CI/testing improvements.\r\n\r\nThis release also sees a bumper crop of new contributors, thanks to [@dehume](https://github.com/dehume), [@andychannery](https://github.com/andychannery), [@Kylea650](https://github.com/Kylea650), [@robin-alphasophia](https://github.com/robin-alphasophia), [@jtbg](https://github.com/jtbg), [@r-petit](https://github.com/r-petit), [@bpfaust](https://github.com/bpfaust), [@freewaydev](https://github.com/freewaydev) & [@abdel](https://github.com/abdel) who all made the first contibutions in this release! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\n## What\u2019s Changed\r\n\r\n* Oracle space between alias and column reference [#5313](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5313) [@joaostorrer](https://github.com/joaostorrer)\r\n* Don't apply LT05 on templated rebreak locations #5096 [#5318](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5318) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Disable JJ01 unless jinja active [#5319](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5319) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Cache the `BaseSegment` hash in reflow [#5320](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5320) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Better error reporting for invalid macros [#5317](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5317) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Add support for begin atomic functions in Postgres [#5316](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5316) [@joaostorrer](https://github.com/joaostorrer)\r\n* Fix parsing when statement uses plus_sign_join and function in Oracle [#5315](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5315) [@joaostorrer](https://github.com/joaostorrer)\r\n* Update rule docs with correct config [#5314](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5314) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Resolve #5258.

We're in the process of upgrading some quite old code in the parser, most of which should not be visible to end users (apart from perhaps some performance improvements!).\r\n\r\nThis release also allows missing template variables in the placeholder templater to be automatically filled with the name of the variable rather than raising an error (see: [#5101](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5101)).\r\n\r\nBeyond that this includes some dialect improvements for DuckDB, SparkSQL, Snowflake, Redshift & Postgres.\r\n\r\nThanks particularly to

    "body": "## Highlights\r\n\r\nThis release brings one new dialect, two new rules and some changes to the CLI:\r\n- We now support the [trino](https://trino.io/) dialect. This is a first version of support, so do post any issues on GitHub in the usual way. This was also the first contribution to the project from [@efung](https://github.com/efung) \ud83c\udfc6.\r\n- `ST09` / `structure.join_condition_order`: Which checks whether tables referenced in `JOIN` clauses are referenced in the order of their definition. By default this means that in the `ON` clause, the column referencing the table in the `FROM` clause should come before the column referencing the table in the `JOIN` clause (e.g. `... FROM a JOIN b on a.c = b.c`). This rule was also the first contribution to the project from [@thibonacci](https://github.com/thibonacci) \ud83c\udfc6.\r\n- `AL08` / `aliasing.unique.column`: Which checks that column aliases and names are not repeated within the same `SELECT` clause. This is normally an error as it implies the same column has been imported twice, or that two expressions have been given the same alias.\r\n- The `--profiler` option on `sqlfluff parse` has been removed. It was only present on the `parse` command and not `lint` or `fix`, and it is just as simple to invoke the python `cProfiler` directly.\r\n- The `--recurse` cli option and `sqlfluff.recurse` configuration option have both been removed. They both existed purely for debugging the parser, and were never used in a production setting. The improvement in other debugging messages when unparsable sections are found means that this option is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nAlong side these more significant changes this also includes:\r\n- Performance optimisations for `AL04`, `AL05`, `AM04`, `RF01` & `ST05` which cumulatively may save up to 30% on the total time spend in the linting phase for some projects.\r\n- Dialect improvements for Oracle & TSQL.\r\n\r\n## What\u2019s Changed\r\n\r\n* Remove IdentitySet [#5093](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5093) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Stricter typing in smaller sqlfluff.core.parser [#5088](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5088) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Preliminary support of Trino dialect [#4913](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/4913) [@efung](https://github.com/efung)\r\n* Rename ST09 [#5091](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5091) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* TSQL: Fix Clustered Index asc/desc [#5090](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5090) [@greg-finley](https://github.com/greg-finley)\r\n* Parent references and more efficient path_to [#5076](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5076) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* New Rule: AL08 - column aliases must be unique [#5079](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5079) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Add support for fetch first row(s) only in Oracle [#5089](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5089) [@joaostorrer](https://github.com/joaostorrer)\r\n* Fix bug around quoted identifiers for ST09 [#5087](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5087) [@thibonacci](https://github.com/thibonacci)\r\n* Add strict typing to the templating tracer [#5085](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5085) [@WittierDinosaur](https://github.com/WittierDinosaur)\r\n* Remove recurse config [#5065](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5065) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* \u2705 Strictly type dialect [#5067](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5067) [@pwildenhain](https://github.com/pwildenhain)\r\n* Add new rule ST09: Joins should list the table referenced earlier (default)/later first [#4974](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/4974) [@thibonacci](https://github.com/thibonacci)\r\n* Remove the internal cProfiler option [#5081](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5081) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n* Optimisation on select analysis [#5082](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/5082) [@alanmcruickshank](https://github.com/alanmcruickshank)\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* [@thibonacci](https://github.com/thibonacci) made their first contribution in [#4974](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/4974)\r\n* [@efung](https://github.com/efung) made their first contribution in [#4913](https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/4913)",
