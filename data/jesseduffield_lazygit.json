    "body": "It's time for another Lazygit release! Thanks to all who contributed to this release.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Enhancements \ud83d\udd25\r\n* Preserve pending commit message when closing/re-opening by @AzraelSec in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4191\r\n* Swap position of checkout-commit and checkout-branch menu items by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4238\r\n  * In a previous release we had made it so that when you press space on a commit, the first option in the menu was to check out the corresponding branch, rather than the commit itself. We've made it so that now the first option is to check out the commit itself, for the sake of everybody's muscle memory.\r\n* Allow user to filter the files view to only show untracked files by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4226\r\n* Expose {{.SelectedCommitRange}} to custom commands by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4204\r\n* Show background fetch status in bottom line by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4215\r\n* Support copying tags to clipboard by @brunofjesus in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4218\r\n* Add option to delete local and remote tag by @AnvarU in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4217\r\n* Show confirmation menu when trying to amend changes while there are conflicts by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4222\r\n* Improve error reporting on config migration by @kas2020-commits in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4210\r\n* Show files filter status by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4230\r\n* Improve contrast of highlighted search results by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4242\r\n\r\n### Fixes \ud83d\udd27\r\n* Don't try killing processes if we already know the command finished by @brandondong in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4231\r\n  * We believe this was causing all sorts of problems for windows users.\r\n* Add '--' to 'git rev-list' to disambiguate branch name from path by @efussi in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4185\r\n* Fix adding blank line at end of commit message by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4182\r\n* Fix checking out a different branch while pushing a branch for the first time by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4214\r\n* Fix tag being truncated when copying to clipboard by @brunofjesus in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4232\r\n* Disable staging and unstaging lines or hunks when the diff context size is 0 by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4235\r\n* Fix incorrect stash diff after rename by @brandondong in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4213\r\n* Fix possible crash when deleting a branch while filtering is active by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4195\r\n* Fix pasting multi-line text into commit message panel by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4234\r\n* fix: properly detect icon for BAZEL and WORKSPACE files by @PeterCardenas in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4252\r\n* Fix json schema for context of CustomCommand by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4255\r\n### Maintenance \u2699\ufe0f\r\n* Bump go-deadlock version to fix crash with go 1.23 in debug mode by @ChrisMcD1 in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4248\r\n* Fix auto-release workflow by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4265\r\n### I18n \ud83c\udf0e\r\n* Update translations; includes a new Portuguese translation by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4250\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @efussi made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4185\r\n* @brunofjesus made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4218\r\n* @AnvarU made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4217\r\n* @kas2020-commits made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4210\r\n* @ChrisMcD1 made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4248\r\n* @PeterCardenas made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4252\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.45.2...v0.46.0\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\nLots of great changes in this release. Thanks to everybody who contributed!\r\n\r\n### Enhancements \ud83d\udd25\r\n* Per-repo config files (and reloading of edited config files) by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3787\r\n\t* In addition to the global config file you can now create repo-specific config files in\u00a0`<repo>/.git/lazygit.yml`. Settings in these files override settings in the global config file. In addition, files called\u00a0`.lazygit.yml`\u00a0in any of the parent directories of a repo will also be loaded; this can be useful if you have settings that you want to apply to a group of repositories.\r\n\t* We now also automatically apply (most) config changes without the need to restart lazygit\r\n* Easily view diff across range of commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3869\r\n\t* If you select a range of commits, we now show the diff across the range (inclusive). This makes it easy to see the total changes across a number of commits. Likewise, if you press enter when a range of commits are selected, we will show the changed files for the range.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6646c78b-5770-41c1-93b9-5442d32404de\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n* Support hyperlinks from pagers by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3825\r\n\t* If you're using delta as a pager (which I highly recommend trying), you can now click on line numbers to go to that line in your editor by using the following config:\r\n\t```yaml\r\n\tgit:\r\n\t  paging:\r\n\t    colorArg: always\r\n\t    pager: delta --paging=never --line-numbers --hyperlinks --hyperlinks-file-link-format=\"lazygit-edit://{path}:{line}\"\r\n\t```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75fef6c4-d437-4595-ab00-b8990215cfed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Switch to Files panel after popping/applying a stash by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3888\r\n\t* This is a nice quality of life improvement. You generally want to go straight to the files panel after you pop or apply from the stash\r\n* Ask to auto-stage unstaged files when continuing a rebase after resolving conflicts by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3879\r\n\t* Another quality of life improvement: often you resolve some conflicts, then make another couple changes, then in lazygit you say to continue and you get an error saying there are unstaged changes. Now instead of showing an error, lazygit asks if you want to stage those changes and continue.\r\n* Offer autostash option when creating new branch by @brandondong in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3871\r\n\t* Another great quality of life improvement\r\n* Allow using shell aliases in interactive custom commands by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3793\r\n* Switch tabs with panel jump keys by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3794\r\n\t* If you've already been using the number keys (1-5) for jumping to specific side panels, you'll be pleased to know that you can now also use those keys for jumping to tabs within a side panel. E.g. to go to the reflog panel, you can now press 4 to jump to the commits panel, then 4 again to go to the reflog tab.\r\n* Rename \"Custom Command\" to \"Shell Command\" by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3800\r\n\t* There are two ways of invoking a 'custom' command in Lazygit: first by pre-defining a command in your config, and second by pressing ':' and typing in the command directly. We referred to both of these as 'custom commands' which was confusing. We now refer to the second approach as invoking a 'shell command'.\r\n* Improve template placeholders for custom commands by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3809\r\n\t* Now you can use `SelectedCommit` to refer to the selected commit regardless of which commits panel you're in (local commits, reflog, etc)\r\n\t* Likewise, you can use `SelectedPath` whether you're in the files panel or the commit-files panel.\r\n* feat(custom command): support multiple contexts within one command by @yam-liu in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3784\r\n\t* You can now use a comma-separated list of contexts for which a custom command can be invoked. For example:\r\n\t```yaml\r\n\tcustomCommands:\r\n\t  - description: 'Add empty commit'\r\n\t    key: 'E'\r\n\t    context: 'commits,files'\r\n\t```\r\n* Improve mouse support for commit message panel by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3836\r\n* Make auto-staging resolved conflicts optional by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3870\r\n\t* If you set `git.autoStageResolvedConflicts` to false in your config, lazygit will no longer auto-stage files in which you've resolved merge conflicts.\r\n* Allow using `<`/`>` and `,`/`.` in sticky range select mode in patch explorer by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3837\r\n* Add Zed editor support to editorPreset by @susl in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3886\r\n\r\n### Fixes \ud83d\udd27\r\n* Allow GPG reword for last commit by @Neko-Box-Coder in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3815\r\n* Don't exit app when GetRepoPaths call fails during startup by @ppoum in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3779\r\n* Fix lack of icon when extension isn't lowercase by @hasecilu in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3810\r\n* Fix redraw bug (stale content) in commits view by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3783\r\n* Fix line coloring when using the delta pager by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3820\r\n* Fix pressing escape after clicking in diff view by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3828\r\n* Fix fast-forward issue caused by a conflicting tag name @Neko-Box-Coder in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3807\r\n* Fix range select -> stage failure when deleted file is already staged by @brandondong in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3631\r\n* Scroll views up if needed to show all their content by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3839\r\n* Fix crash when filtering commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3838\r\n* Fix cancelled autostash resulting in stuck inline status by @brandondong in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3860\r\n* Don't allow opening a menu while the search or filter prompt is open by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3878\r\n\r\n### Maintenance \u2699\ufe0f\r\n* Reapply \"Check for fixup commits on CI\" by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3745\r\n* Some cleanups for APIs related to contexts by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3808\r\n* Improve fixup commits script by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3853\r\n* Fix linter warnings by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3854\r\n* Add codespell support (config, workflow to detect/not fix) and make it fix few typos by @yarikoptic in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3751\r\n* Get rid of a lot of error return values by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3890\r\n* Add a readme file for the JSON files in pkg/i18n/translations by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3781\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @yam-liu made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3784\r\n* @ppoum made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3779\r\n* @Neko-Box-Coder made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3815\r\n* @yarikoptic made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3751\r\n* @susl made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3886\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.43.1...v0.44.0",

    "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\nThanks to all contributors who helped make this release happen! There's a lot of first-time contributors on this release as well so kudos to you all.\r\n\r\nThere's quite a few things in this release. I'm going to single out a couple that have changed my workflow.\r\n\r\n### Base branch stuff\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f50824a-6221-4ca0-9cf3-a4d45cc43262\r\n\r\n#### Easier rebase onto base branch\r\n\r\n_(Add command to rebase onto base branch by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3615)_\r\n\r\nWhen my feature branch gets out of date with the main branch, I like to rebase it onto the main branch. Up until now, that's required:\r\n* Navigating to the main branch\r\n* Pressing 'f' to fast-forward it onto its upstream branch\r\n* Pressing 'r' to rebase the checked-out branch onto the main branch\r\n\r\nThat takes too long! Now you can just press 'r' followed by 'b' to rebase onto the base branch (which defaults to origin/main).\r\n\r\n#### See the divergence count from the base branch\r\n\r\n_(Divergence from base branch display by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3613)_\r\n\r\nYou can now also configure to see the divergence from a branch and its base branch with the following config:\r\n```yml\r\ngui:\r\n    showDivergenceFromBaseBranch: arrowAndNumber # or 'onlyArrow'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows the divergence count in blue, next to the yellow count of divergence from the upstream branch. This is admittedly noisy, so it's an opt-in feature. But I think the noise is worth it.\r\n\r\nIf you set the config value to 'onlyArrow' it's a lot less noisy:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"891\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/470cb003-8fc6-4a72-aa04-6e228c49f381\">\r\n\r\n#### See detailed divergence from base branch\r\n\r\n_(Add command to show divergence from base branch as a left-right log by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3614)_\r\n\r\nBy pressing 'u' then 'b' on a branch you can see the divergence view for that branch compared to its base branch\r\n\r\n### Improved 'Find commit for fixup' feature\r\n\r\n_(Improve the \"Find base commit for fixup\" command by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3602)_\r\n\r\n'Find commit for fixup' is not a very catchy name for this feature but I can't think of anything better at the moment. Nevertheless! The idea is that you often want to know for a given set of changes, which commit ought they be included in? Just press `ctrl+f` when in the files panel and lazygit will jump the cursor to the appropriate commit to fixup.\r\n\r\nWith this release, the feature is smarter and more lenient so it's more likely to find you a match. If you haven't tried this out you should really give it a go! \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/220e4190-b631-40a5-b8dc-7d1a6116ab09\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other Enhancements \ud83d\udd25\r\n* Add Squash merge by @noahfraiture in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3566\r\n\t* Now when you press `shift+m` you get the option to do a regular merge or a squash merge. If you already have muscle memory for regular merge; don't worry: it's the same sequence of keypresses.\r\n* Improve \"Find base commit for fixup\" command when there are changes for master commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3645\r\n* Allow setting the similarity threshold for detecting renames by @isti115 in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3025\r\n\t* For this, press ')' and '(' to increase/decrease the similarity threshold.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a85825b8-9110-4090-ba89-ba8221cbc7a8\r\n\r\n\r\n* Reduce memory consumption when loading large number of commits by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3687\r\n  * 2-6x less memory usage when dealing with lots of commits. HUGE improvement.\r\n* Focus on local commits view after moving code into new commit by @AzraelSec in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3577\r\n* Add property outputTitle to CustomCommand by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3579\r\n* Add user config `gui.expandedSidePanelWeight` by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3623\r\n\t* You can now increase the height of the selected side panel when you've configured the accordion effect\r\n\t```yml\r\n\tgui:\r\n      expandFocusedSidePanel: true\r\n      expandedSidePanelWeight: 3\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n<img width=\"891\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a47bd1c-67b0-4d2f-a885-56e6a07ece12\">\r\n\r\n* Support range select for amending commit attributes by @AzraelSec in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3587\r\n\t* This lets you select a range of commits and update the author / set the co-author on all of them at once.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d3e15a9-4acc-4b81-b0e2-a34490ad77ad\r\n\r\n* Show \"exec\" todos in the list of rebase todos by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3654\r\n* Search the model instead of the view in the commits panel by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3642\r\n* Add prompt

clipboard by @WaterLemons2k in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3676\r\n* Stagger popup panels by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/3694\r\n* Make commit

    "body": "Hold on tight because this is a HUGE release! This release includes a whopping 595 commits from a period of over 7 months, from 40 different contributors. Thanks to everybody who made this possible, and apologies for taking so long to actually release it: we'll be more frequent in future!\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Stefan Haller who is behind many of this release's changes and who has been critical in getting this release across the line.\r\n\r\nI've made a video running through the big changes here:\r\n\r\n[<img src=\"https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/f9b47c5e-f8b2-4b41-8f51-bf06b01046e2\">](https://youtu.be/_REmkoIyPW0)\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\nHere's some highlighted features:\r\n\r\n### Range select\r\n\r\n![range-select](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\nYou can now press 'v' to toggle range select in any list view, just like you already could in the staging view. You can also press shift+up/down to select a range. You can use range select to:\r\n* stage/discard a range of files\r\n* select multiple commits to fixup/squash/move outside an interactive rebase\r\n* select multiple commits to mark as fixup/squash/etc within an interactive rebase\r\n* select multiple commit files to discard or add to a custom patch (courtesy of @afhoffman)\r\n* select multiple commits to cherry-pick\r\n\r\nI have been waiting for this feature for a very long time and it's already made me way more productive. If I need to squash a range of commits I can now easily do it directly rather than needing to squash them one-by-one, or needing to manually start an interactive rebase first. Likewise, it's much easier to select a range of files and stage them than stage them one-by-one.\r\n\r\nThis is a **Breaking change**: Unfortunately, the 'v' key clashes with the existing key for pasting commits (cherry-pick), so we've replaced that with shift+V and changed the commit copy key to shift+C. If you want the old keybindings back, you can do that like so:\r\n```yml\r\nkeybinding:\r\n  universal:\r\n      toggleRangeSelect: <something other than v>\r\n    commits:\r\n      cherryPickCopy: 'c'\r\n      pasteCommits: 'v'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Auto-wrap in commit editor \r\n\r\nThe commit editor now automatically hard-wraps your content by default, so you no longer need to hit the enter key yourself when you approach the margin. You can disable/configure this in your config:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ngit:\r\n  commit:\r\n    autoWrapCommitMessage: true\r\n    autoWrapWidth: 72\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Easier remote branch checkout\r\n\r\nNow when you go to checkout a remote branch, either via the `c` keybinding in the branches view or by pressing `space` on a remote branch, you'll be given the choice to checkout as a local branch or as a detached head (previously it would just check it out as a detached head which typically isn't what you want). This is a **Breaking change** in terms of muscle memory.\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Easier start interactive rebase\r\n\r\nPreviously, to start an interactive rebase, you would need to navigate to a base commit and press `e` on it. Now you can simply press `i` and regardless of which commit is selected, an interactive rebase will begin that includes all the commits on your branch (or if there are merge commits: all the commits up to first merge commit). \r\n\r\nThe above demo for range select showcases this.\r\n\r\n### Easier squashing of `fixup!` commits\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein to the above section, now when you press `shift+S`, you're given the choice of squashing all commits above the selected commit and squashing all commits on the branch, which is what you typically want. This is a **Breaking change** in terms of muscle memory.\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### View divergence from upstream branch\r\n\r\nIf you press `u` on a local branch a menu appears which shows options relating to the branch's upstream. Now, the first option in that menu allows you to view the divergence from the upstream which shows commits to pull and commits to push\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Find appropriate commit for fixup/amend\r\n\r\nThis one is some serious voodoo: if somebody suggests changes in a PR review, you'll often apply the changes, then go hunting for the appropriate commit to fixup/amend. Now, from the files view you can press `ctrl+f` and if Lazygit can identify an appropriate commit with certainty, it will select that commit for you. Pretty cool!\r\n\r\nWe've made the algorithm very strict so that you can always trust the result, but this means in circumstances where we can't know for sure which commit is appropriate (such as when your changes only include added lines), it's left to you to manually find the commit. We're keen to get lots of feedback on this feature to see where the sweet spot is.\r\n\r\nFor more info see [the docs](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Fixup_Commits.md#finding-the-commit-to-create-a-fixup-for)\r\n\r\nThanks to @stefanhaller for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Delete remote branches/tags\r\n\r\nNow when you press `d` on a local branch, remote branch, or tag, you're given the option to delete that branch/tag in the remote.\r\n\r\nThanks to @AzraelSec for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Add co-author to commit\r\n\r\nWhen you press `a` on a commit an option now appears to add a co-author (something GitHub can read).\r\n\r\nThanks to @omaussa for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Filter commits by author\r\n\r\nYou can now filter commits by author via pressing `ctrl+s` in the commits view and selecting the option to filter by author.\r\n\r\nThanks to @Part22 for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Change branch sort order\r\n\r\nYou can now change branch sort order by pressing `s` in the branches view (and remote branches view). By default local branches are sorted by 'recency' meaning how recently they were checked out, but you can now sort by head commit date and alphabetically.\r\n\r\nThanks to @hosaka for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Better bare repo support\r\n\r\nWe have fixed a bunch of bugs relating to bare repos so if you had issues with them in the past it should work fine now.\r\n\r\nThanks to @jwhitley for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Miscelleneous UI changes\r\n\r\n* Unstaged files are now shown in white, not red, which is easier on the eyes\r\n* Scrollbars are thinner (and, thus, cooler)\r\n* Keybindings menu now has section headers (@stefanhaller) \r\n* Error toasts now appear for some errors (less intrusive than popups) (@stefanhaller)\r\n* Search history is now retained (@karimkhaleel)\r\n* Git log is shown by default (@stefanhaller) \r\n\r\n### More Breaking Changes \ud83d\udca5\r\n\r\n* When you press 'g' to bring up the git reset menu, the 'mixed' option is now the first and default, rather than 'soft'. This is because 'mixed' is the most commonly used option.\r\n* Push/pull/fetch loading statuses are now shown against the branch rather than in a popup. This allows you to e.g. fetch multiple branches in parallel and see the status for each branch.\r\n* The git log graph in the commits view is now always shown by default (previously it was only shown when the view was maximised). If you find this too noisy, you can change it back via `ctrl+L` -> 'Show git graph' -> 'when maximised'\r\n* Filtering (e.g. when pressing '/') is less fuzzy by default; it only matches substrings now. Multiple substrings can be matched by separating them with spaces. If you want to revert to the old behavior, set the following in your config:\r\n```yml\r\ngui:\r\n  filterMode: 'fuzzy'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### All Enhancements \ud83d\udd25\r\n* Add

Time flies when you're having fun.\r\n\r\nI've written a post celebrating the anniversary [here](https://jesseduffield.com/Lazygit-5-Years-On).\r\n\r\nAs for this release, we've got some great features here. \r\n\r\n### Worktrees\r\n\r\nWe now have a worktrees view so you can easily create worktrees and switch to them and so on. I'm not a big worktrees user myself so please raise an issue if you can think of places to improve the UX.\r\n\r\n![worktree_create_from_branches-compressed](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/3ef0b085-e9d0-42de-af58-16cbae581d34)\r\n\r\n### Rebase --onto\r\n\r\nRebasing onto a marked base commit is a very useful feature that we've been sorely lacking for a while\r\n(demo coming soon)\r\n\r\n### Auto-refresh on window focus\r\n\r\nAuto-refresh on window activation is a complete game-changer. No more having to manually press shift+R when you come back from your editor.\r\n\r\n### Nuking the worktree\r\n\r\nWe also have a fun enhancement in this release: showing an explosion animation when you nuke the working tree.\r\n\r\n![nuke-gif](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/assets/8456633/32b3f91c-fea3-474d-8997-1de2f5e4f5d4)\r\n\r\nYou'll also notice in the readme we've got some updated demo gifs to showoff Lazygit's features. More of those to come.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Features \u2728\r\n* Add worktrees view by @jesseduffield (with help from @kadaan) in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2147\r\n* Rebase onto branch from a marked base commit by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2835\r\n* Auto-refresh on window activation by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2854\r\n### Enhancements \ud83d\udd25\r\n* Speed up refresh by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2841\r\n* Add os.copyToClipboardCmd to allow for a custom command #1055 by @redstreet in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2784\r\n* Add bisect menu entry that lets you choose bisect terms by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2838\r\n* When bisecting, always mark the current commit as good/bad, not the selected by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2837\r\n* Visualize local branch heads in commits panel, 2nd approach by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2775\r\n* Allow force-tagging if tag exists by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2827\r\n* Save IgnoreWhitespaceInDiffView in state.yml by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2830\r\n* Show loader when rebasing by @KarlHeitmann in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2851\r\n* Internationalise logging of commands by @KarlHeitmann in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2852\r\n* Show visual explosion effect when nuking worktree by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2861\r\n### Fixes \ud83d\udd27\r\n* Fix issue where using `null` to un-map a keybinding was ignored by @hatredholder in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2832\r\n* Show error when trying to open patch menu with an empty patch by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2829\r\n* Fix merge status for update-ref command by @stefanhaller in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2845\r\n* Stop worktrees view from stealing the window by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2863\r\n* Fix confirmation view sizing by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2879\r\n### Maintenance \u2699\ufe0f\r\n* Standardise on using lo for slice functions by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2846\r\n* Remove redundant secureexec package by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2847\r\n* Add automated demo recordings by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2853\r\n* Remove file watcher code by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2865\r\n* Add more demos to the README by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2866\r\n* Move features to top of readme by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2867\r\n* Add more demos by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2874\r\n### Other Changes\r\n* Create demo output dir if it doesn't already exist by @jesseduffield in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2857\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @hatredholder made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2832\r\n* @redstreet made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2784\r\n* @kadaan made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2147\r\n* @KarlHeitmann made their first contribution in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2851\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.39.4...v0.40.0\r\n\r\n",

We're going to revisit the UX for this before considering re-introducing it. If you would like to re-enable the feature, set `gui.experimentalShowBranchHeads` to `true` in the lazygit config. As the name suggests, this is experimental and we may change this config in the future.\r\n \r\n * https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2582 Make branch head markers in compact view opt-in (@stefanhaller)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/compare/v0.38.0...v0.38.1\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "# v0.38\r\n\r\n_Most recent patch: [v0.38.2](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/tag/v0.38.2)_\r\n\r\nWe've got lots of goodies in this release. Some notable improvements are a revamped commit message panel (@seand52), much better interactive rebase behaviour (@stefanhaller), and much less error-prone custom patch behaviour (also @stefanhaller).\r\n\r\nAs you can see, @mark2185 and @Ryooooooga continue their reign as top contributors, but we are now also joined by @stefanhaller who is behind many of the big improvements in this release. I'd also like to give a special shoutout to @seand52 who's behind the revamped commit message panel. And thank you to all the other contributors who contributed towards this release: @AKARSHITJOSHI, @axieax, @AzraelSec, @humblepenguinn, @jbrains, @jenskutilek, @knutwalker, @pereBohigas, @scallaway, @shinhs0506, @ShrutiC-git, @TylerBarnes, and @yk-kd.\r\n\r\nAs always if you're interested in contributing to Lazygit, don't hesitate to pick an issue and have a Go (pardon the pun), and if you'd like to support me please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/jesseduffield).\r\n\r\nOn a more boring note intended for current/future contributors, we've now fully migrated to a new integration test pattern which makes it much easier to test your changes and prevent regressions. We've also got a huge refactor PR (https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2519) that's about to go in right after this release goes out, so if you have a PR open that now has conflicts, reach out to me (@jesseduffield) and I can help resolve them.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* 'x' no longer opens the menu, you'll need to use '?' or remap the keybinding. We did this so that we could use 'x' for destructive actions like nuking the working tree, as some people accidentally double-tapped 'D' and ... nuked their working tree)\r\n* You can no longer use 'y' or 'n' to respond to a confirmation popup. Instead you'll need to use 'enter' or 'esc'. This is again just freeing up keybindings for more uses.\r\n* We've changed how you configure your editor settings because it was a bit of a mess previously. See [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md#configuring-file-editing) for the new approach. You'll get deprecation warnings upon closing lazygit until adjusting your config, so that nobody gets mad when we remove support in a following release.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2390 Revamp commit message panel (we now have a separate summary and description panel where 'enter' adds newlines in the description panel) (@seand52)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2421 Allow creating tags on branches with the 'T' keybinding (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2453 Allow rebasing to first commit (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2476 Add icons for Kotlin files (@pereBohigas)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2433 Lazy-load commits when viewed within a branch (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2370 Allow interactively rebasing onto a branch (@AzraelSec)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2344 Allow customising panel border styling with `gui.border` (single/double/rounded/hidden) (@yk-kd)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2485 Allow rewording the HEAD commit while rebasing (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2552 Better support for stacked branches via the `rebase.updateRefs` git config (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2496 Omit custom commands from history when they start with a space (@mark2185)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2558 Allow resetting author during rebase (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2523 Improve editor config (@stefanhaller)\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2418 Allow copying remote branch name to clipboard (@mark2185)\r\n\r\n## Fixes/Minor Improvements\r\n* https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2471, https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2507 Improve custom patch conflict handling (This is a big deal!

    "body": "## Features\r\n\r\n* Nerd fonts now supported! (@Ryooooooga)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/179950774-ff20e6bc-1b0a-493e-9db9-86dcf2dc71aa.png)\r\n\r\n* Scrollbars! (non-interactive but cool nonetheless)\r\n* Diff hunks can now be edited directly (via a subprocess) (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* You can open lazygit to the panel that you care about e.g. run `lazygit log` to open lazygit to the commits panel. (@HiromasaNojima)\r\n* Most menus now have their own keybindings for each menu item, which should speed things up for power users.\r\n* You can now easily set/unset the upstream of a branch (@mark2185)\r\n* You can now select to stash exclusively unstaged/staged files (@mark2185)\r\n* Improved update flow (@moha-gh)\r\n* Fixed issue where we duplicated line breaks when parsing a commit message Don't duplicate line breaks when retrieving commit message (@moha-gh)\r\n* Some hard-to-reverse actions now have confirmation popups given it's easy to accidentally press the wrong key.\r\n* 'Gone' branches are now marked as such\r\n* More commit attributes can be copied with the 'y' key (@mark2185)\r\n* Custom commit author colours can now be specified with regular names (e.g. 'red') instead of only hex codes. (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* Commit author can now be set to another author or reset to the current git user (thanks @JensPfeifle)\r\n* Auto-refresh of files can be disabled with the `git.autoRefresh` config option (@moha-gh)\r\n* We now (again) honour push.default config value. In general we want to err on the side of having git commands do the same thing that would happen if you ran them directly from the terminal.\r\n* Files can now be opened from the merge conflicts panel (thanks @Ryooooooga)\r\n* You can now configure to always show the unstaged and staged changes panels, regardless of whether the selected file has both unstaged and staged changes. This can be done via `gui.splitDiff: 'always'` (@HiromasaNojima)\r\n* Commit time format can now be customised via the `gui.timeFormat` config key (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* We now record the current directory on switch instead of exit (@davdroman)\r\n* We now support Bitbucket server PRs (thanks @TheBlob42)\r\n* Bottom line (containing some keybindings help) can now be hidden via `gui.showBottomLine: false` in your config.\r\n* You can now show the whole git graph in the commits panel by default via `git.log.showWholeGitGraph: true`\r\n* Some UI tweaks.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Various fixes to bugs relating to double-width characters (@Ryooooooga)\r\n* Typo fixes (@casswedson)\r\n* LOTS of other bug fixes (thanks to the glorious @Ryooooooga and @mark2185)\r\n\r\n## Translation updates:\r\nChinese translated updated (@Crystal-RainSlide)\r\nJapanese translation added (@Ryooooooga)\r\nKorean translation added (@Shin-JaeHeon)\r\n\r\nHUGE thankyou to all the contributors who've helped bring about this release. As you can see @mark2185 and @Ryooooooga are behind many of the the changes so a special thankyou to the both of you!\r\n\r\n## Maintenance stuff:\r\nWe've now on go1.18 meaning we can use generics. The lo package is our main generics helper package. I've also rolled my own, called 'generics', but I'll probably end up just committing to using lo only.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests in CI are now run in parallel, and windows builds are now properly cached, so CI runs much faster and you'll sooner know if you've broken a test.\r\n\r\n## Note from maintainer:\r\n\r\nI'm working on some tricky features like the ability to filter the contents of a list panel, some of which I've recorded on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFQFkdzh_Js&ab_channel=JesseDuffield). As part of that work I've had to make a detour to do some yak shaving and refactoring (which is happening in https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/2023)\r\n\r\nI've also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNavnhzZHtk&ab_channel=JesseDuffield) showing how to add a basic feature to Lazygit for aspiring contributors. If you would like to see similar videos/docs covering other topics to make life easier for new/existing contributors, lemme know!\r\n\r\nAt some point I want to take time off work to go full-time on Lazygit (e.g. for a few months). If you have any ideas how I could raise money to do that, let me know! And of course for all those currently sponsoring, thankyou so much, it's a big motivator for me finding the time to work on this project.\r\n\r\nSome more rambling thoughts:\r\n* The integration test suite has some good coverage but the mechanism behind it (recording a Lazygit session and having the test replay that session) is hard to maintain. I want to switch to having integration tests be built by calling a bunch of commands in sequence, similar to Cypress if anybody's used that.\r\n* I was holding off this release for the sake of a better in-app release notes feature but that can wait for a future release.",

The refactor is about 90% done but the 10% might take some time and it's tricky to have to re-implement all PRs from contributors to the new branch. At any rate this refactor should make the code easier to work with compared to the previous god struct (the Gui struct) that was being used for everything. The new structure no doubt will have its own flaws that I'll need to work through over time. I've been using the refactor PR myself for a while and haven't run into any bugs, and I've added some more integration tests to capture more of the expected behaviour. Don't hesitate to raise an issue for any bug you find.",

It's a convenient way of testing a feature with a given pre-built example repo.\r\n* I've replaced the contributor code of conduct with a very stripped down version that basically says 'be nice'. The original was a little intense and didn't reflect the natural level of charity and positivity in the issues board. If people have an issue with that let me know.\r\n* I've added some extra sections to the contributing guide including:\r\n  - how the codebase (intentionally) diverges from some Go idioms\r\n  - i18n\r\n  - testing\r\n  - debugging\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note from maintainer:\r\n* Still working on this gui package refactor. I expect the health of the codebase to increase quite a bit with the change. I regret not trying to slice it up into smaller pieces but hopefully I'll have learnt my lesson next time.\r\n* We might need to rethink how integration tests are done. Right now it's a direct recording which can make the tests difficult to update.\r\n",

If it hasn't you'll need to run `go run scripts/cheatsheet/main.go generate`\r\n\r\n## Note from maintainer:\r\nThe codebase has grown quite a bit since its inception and it's in need of some refactoring to make future growth easier. I've wrapped up some refactoring to the internal `commands` package so that we've got better namespacing and separation of concerns, and I'll be shifting my gaze to the GUI package next. Once I'm happy with the structure of the code I'll start producing some documentation so that new contributors can easily get started on features and bug fixes. Many changes to the app are trivial to make but it can take a new contributor time to work out where everything lives in the code.\r\n",
