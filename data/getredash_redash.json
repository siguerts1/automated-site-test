Make sure to backup your data. You only need to backup Redash\u2019s PostgreSQL database (the database Redash stores metadata in, not the ones you might be querying) as the data in Redis is transient.\r\n2. Change directory to /opt/redash.\r\n3. Update `/opt/redash/docker-compose.yml` Redash image reference to `redash/redash:10.1.0.b50633`\r\n4. Stop Redash services: `docker-compose stop server scheduler scheduled_worker adhoc_worker` (you might need to list additional services if you updated your configuration)\r\n5. (No migrations are needed when upgrading from 10.0)\r\n6. Read the `Impact` segment at [this link](https://github.com/getredash/redash/security/advisories/GHSA-g8xr-f424-h2rv). If your installation is affected, follow the instructions under the `Patches` heading to secure the secret fields in your database.\r\n7. Start services with docker-compose up -d\r\n\r\n### From V9:\r\nFollow the same steps as V10 but for step 5:\r\n\r\n5. Apply migration: `docker-compose run --rm server manage db upgrade`\r\n\r\n### From V8 or earlier\r\n1. Follow the complete steps outlined in the [V10.0 release ](https://github.com/getredash/redash/releases/tag/v10.0.0) but use this Docker Tag in step 3: `redash/redash:10.1.0.b50633`\r\n2. Read the `Impact` segment at [this link](https://github.com/getredash/redash/security/advisories/GHSA-g8xr-f424-h2rv). If your installation is affected, follow the instructions under the `Patches` heading to secure the secret fields in your database.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So we expect most users upgrading to V10 are coming from V8. The upgrade from V8->V10 is like any other, but since RQ replaced Celery in this version there are a couple extra modifications that need to be done in your `docker-compose.yml`.\r\n\r\nIf you already run the V9-beta release you already made these changes. You can use the [standard upgrade instructions](https://redash.io/help/open-source/admin-guide/how-to-upgrade) instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThese steps are performed on the server that runs Docker.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure to backup your data. You only need to backup Redash\u2019s PostgreSQL database (the database Redash stores metadata in, not the ones you might be querying) as the data in Redis is transient. **Note**: If you just deployed a Redash V8 AMI and have not used it, you can skip this step.\r\n2. `cd /opt/redash`\r\n3. Update `opt/redash/docker-compose.yml` to reference the docker image you want to upgrade to: `redash/redash:10.0.0.b50363`\r\n\r\n![142671233-76952fdb-1d0b-4f54-8825-a13cc4814874](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17067911/142930648-6c5bc948-0370-4e87-a06a-3c7eb6eacacf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Under `services.scheduler.environment` omit `QUEUES` and `WORKERS_COUNT` and omit environment altogether if it is empty.\r\n\r\n![142671147-2b3d1755-01a0-4561-86d4-0fff2a3d6862](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17067911/142930681-49606421-c644-4007-a650-34b6366bc161.png)\r\n5. Under `services`, add a new service for general RQ jobs:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nworker:\r\n  <<: *redash-service\r\n  command: worker\r\n  environment:\r\n    QUEUES: \"periodic emails default\"\r\n    WORKERS_COUNT: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n![142671560-a8263e3b-0435-4327-ae46-c669f8a21b79](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17067911/142930697-ed7d2881-ca3f-4449-a096-b906f1d983c8.png)\r\n\r\n6. Stop Redash services: `docker-compose stop server scheduler scheduled_worker adhoc_worker` (you might need to list additional services if you defined them in your `docker-compose.yml` previously)\r\n7. Force a recreation of your containers with `docker-compose up --force-recreate --build`\r\n8. Run the necessary migrations with `docker-compose run --rm server manage db upgrade`\r\n9. Restart the containers `docker-compose up -d`\r\n\r\n## Dashboard URL Changes\r\n\r\nDashboard URLs now include the dashboard id and slug.\r\n\r\nFor example, given a dashboard with the slug `account-overview` and an id of `251`:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n`https://redash.app/dashboards/account-overview`\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n`https://redash.app/dashboards/251-account-overview`\r\n\r\nThe dashboard can also be reached using the new `/dashboard` (notice this is singular) endpoint. It accepts _either_ an ID or a slug:\r\n\r\n- `https://redash.app/dashboard/251`\r\n- `https://redash.app/dashboard/account-overview`\r\n\r\nEither of these will redirect to the **After** link above. Dashboard ID's are guaranteed to be unique. But dashboards can share the same slug. If a user visits `/dashboard/<some slug>` and more than one dashboard exists with that slug, they will be redirected to the earliest created dashboard with that slug.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Before doing an upgrade, please make sure you have a backup.\r\n* If you have any issues, please refer to the troubleshooting section in the upgrade guide.\r\n* If the upgrade guide doesn't help, you can ask for help on the forum.",

Since RQ has replaced Celery in this version, there are a couple extra modifications that need to be done in your docker-compose.yml:\r\n\r\n1. Under services/scheduler/environment, omit QUEUES and WORKERS_COUNT (and omit environment altogether if it is empty).\r\n2. Under services, add a new service for general RQ jobs:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nworker:\r\n  <<: *redash-service\r\n  command: worker\r\n  environment:\r\n    QUEUES: \"periodic emails default\"\r\n    WORKERS_COUNT: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollowing that, force a recreation of your containers with docker-compose up --force-recreate --build and you should be good to go.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Before doing an upgrade, please make sure you have a backup.\r\n* If you have any issues, please refer to the troubleshooting section in the [upgrade guide](https://redash.io/help/open-source/admin-guide/how-to-upgrade).\r\n* If the upgrade guide doesn't help, you can ask for help on the [forum](https://discuss.redash.io/c/support/support-self-hosted).

Check the Settings page to enable this feature.\r\n\r\nThere were also important changes to the code and infrastructure: \r\n\r\n* More components moved to React.\r\n* We switched to Webpack 4 with the help of @dmonego.\r\n* We upgraded to Celery 4 with the help of @emtwo, @jezdez, @mashrikt and @atharvai.\r\n* We started moving towards Python 3 for our backend. The first step was to make sure our code pass basic sanity tests with Flake 8, which was implemented by @cclauss.\r\n* We improved our testing on the frontend by adding setup for Jest tests and E2E testing using Cypress (@gabrieldutra).\r\n* Each pull request now gets a deploy preview using Netlify to easily test frontend changes.\r\n\r\nThis is just a summary, you're welcome to review the full CHANGELOG.\r\n\r\nThis release had contributions from 38 people: @arikfr, @kravets-levko, @jezdez, @kyoshidajp, @kocsmy, @alison985, @gabrieldutra, @washort, @GitSumito, @emtwo, @rauchy, @alexanderlz, @denisov-vlad, @ariarijp, @yoavbls, @zhujunsan, @sjakthol, @koooge, @SakuradaJun, @dmonego, @Udomomo, @cclauss, @combineads, @zaimy, @Trigl, @ralphilius, @jodevsa, @deecay, @igorcanadi, @pashaxp, @hoangphuoc25, @toph, @burnash, @wankdanker, @Yossi-a, @Rovel, @kadrach, and @nicof38. **Thank you, everyone** \ud83d\ude4f\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Before doing an upgrade, please make sure you have a backup.\r\n* Because of the Celery upgrade, before upgrading to this version please make sure to clear out your Celery queues.\r\n* If you have any issues, please refer to the troubleshooting section in the [upgrade guide ](https://redash.io/help/open-source/admin-guide/how-to-upgrade).\r\n* If the upgrade guide doesn\u2019t help, you can ask for help on the [forum ](https://discuss.redash.io/c/support/support-self-hosted).\r\n---\r\n\r\nHappy querying :nerd_face:"
