    "body": "## Features\r\n\r\n### Move per-element type interfaces into core and more strictly type IntrinsicElements (#4546, thanks @rschristian)\r\n\r\nThis adds per-element typings for every DOM-node type, this means that our types might become slightly stricter when you are using DOM attributes/properties where they are not allowed, an example of this might be `<div src=\"x\" />`.\r\n\r\nIf you notice any issues when upgrading tell us about them, we can evaluate whether we have missed a case.\r\n\r\n### Recreate unkeyed functional components when they change position. (#4550, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n\r\nThis is a long time bugfix, when we have elements that look like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn (\r\n\t{condition ? <Element /> : null}\r\n\t{condition ? null : <Element />\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would reuse the state of the first VNode to render the second one when the condition switches. When you are using `key`, this issue was not present.\r\n\r\n### Support `{ handleEvent() {} }` object interface as a listener (#4538, thanks @lilnasy)\r\n\r\nWe've added support for attaching object/class event-handlers\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet handler = {\r\n\tonclick,\r\n\thandleEvent() {\r\n\t\tthis.onclick()\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n<div onClick={handler} />\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n- Ensure state updates work in signals (#4560, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Ensure SVGAttributes includes height & width (#4556, thanks @rschristian)\r\n- Fork types for TS 5.1 and beyond (#4548, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Re-add missing properties & property casings (#4554, thanks @rschristian)\r\n- Ensure we unwrap custom .then() (#4547, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Fix error message when nesting invalid elements within \\<p\\> tags (#4534, thanks @jubalm)\r\n\r\n## Maintenance\r\n\r\n- Try constant for undefined (#4552, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Fix demo (#4551, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Use `Signalish` helper to reduce verbosity (#4545, thanks @rschristian)\r\n- Re-export ErrorInfo type (#4541, thanks @jose-torres-marin)\r\n- Skip PR reporter action on non-pull request triggers (#4536, thanks @rschristian)\r\n- upgrade biome to 1.9.4 (#4535, thanks @unvalley)\r\n- oxlint violation of `react/iframe-missing-sandbox` (#4533, thanks @DonIsaac)",
