Now autopilot will start the reconciliation process by attempting to demote a failed voter node before any promotions, fixing the issue where Vault would initially increase quorum when faced with a failure of a voter node. In certain configurations, especially when using Vault Enterprise Redundancy Zones and losing a voter then a non-voter in quick succession, this would lead to a loss of quorum and cluster failure.
