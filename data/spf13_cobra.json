Now, the check for groups has been moved to `ExecuteC` and provides more flexibility when working with grouped commands - @marckhouzam (and shout out to @aawsome, @andig and @KINGSABRI for a deep investigation into this! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc)",

    "body": "### Summer 2022 Release\r\n\r\nSome exciting changes make their way to Cobra! Command completions continue to get better and better (including adding `--help` and `--version` automatic flags to the completions list). Grouping is now possible in your help output as well! And you can now use the `OnFinalize` method to cleanup things when all \"work\" is done. Checkout the full changelog below:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Features \ud83c\udf20 \r\n- Add groups for commands in help: @aawsome @marckhouzam #1003 \r\n- Support for case-insensitive command names: @YuviGold #1802 \r\n- Expose `ValidateRequiredFlags` and `ValidateFlagGroups`: @skeetwu #1760\r\n- Add `--version` flag to help output: @fnickels #1707 \r\n- Add `--help` and `--version` flag in completions: @marckhouzam #1813 \r\n- Add `OnFinalize` method: @yann-soubeyrand #1788 \r\n- Allow user to add completion for powershell alias: @marckhouzam #1621\r\n- Make `InitDefaultcompletionCmd` public: @gssbzn #1467  \r\n\r\n#### Deprecation \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc \r\n- `ExactValidArgs` is deprecated (but not being removed entirely). This is abit nuanced, so checkout #1643 for further information and the [updated `user_guide.md`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/main/user_guide.md) on how this may affect you (and how you can take advantage of the _correct_ behavior in the validators): @umarcor #1643\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes \ud83d\udc1b \r\n- Fix (bash-v2) `activeHelp` length check syntax: @scop #1762\r\n- Fix correct command path in `see_also` for yaml documentation: @zregvart #1771\r\n- Fix showing flags that shadow parent persistent flag in child help messaging: @brianpursley #1776 \r\n\r\n#### Dependencies \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f \r\n- Upgrade to use `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`: @tklauser #1766\r\n\r\n#### Testing \ud83e\udd14 \r\n- Test on Golang 1.19: @umarcor & @jpmcb #1782 \r\n- Renamed powershell completion tests: @marckhouzam #1803 \r\n- Use `action/setup-go` cache: @umarcor #1783 \r\n- Add `workflow_dispatch` to CI actions: @umarcor #1387 \r\n- Add minimum GitHub token permissions for workflows: @varunsh-coder #1792 \r\n\r\n#### Docs \u270f\ufe0f \r\n- Fixup spelling for GitHub CLI: @eltociear #1744\r\n- Clarify `SetContext` documentation: @katexochen #1748 \r\n- Instruct user to `go install` for binary: @marckhouzam #1726 \r\n- User guide cleanup: @marckhouzam #1656 \r\n- Document option to hide the default completion command: @marckhouzam #1779 \r\n\r\n#### Misc \ud83d\udcad \r\n- Add KubeVirt, CloudQuery, Cilium, Okteto, Zitadel, Allero to projects using cobra: @maiqueb #1741, @yevgenypats #1742, @tklauser #1745, @jLopezbarb #1759, @fforootd #1772, @dimabru #1819 \r\n- Use correct stale action `exempt` yaml keys: @jpmcb #1800 \r\n- Add missing license headers: @umarcor #1809 \r\n\r\n_Note:_ Per #1804, we will be moving away from \"seasonal\" releases and doing more generic point release targets. Continue to track the milestones and issues in the `spf13/cobra` GitHub repository for more information!\r\n\r\nGreat work everyone! Cobra would never be possible without your contributions! \ud83d\udc0d\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0",

    "body": "## Spring 2022 Release \ud83c\udf25\ufe0f \r\n\r\nHello everyone! Welcome to another release of cobra. Completions continue to get better and better. This release adds a few really cool new features. We also continue to patch versions of our dependencies as they become available via dependabot. Happy coding!\r\n\r\n## Active help \ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffc \r\nShout out to @marckhouzam for a big value add: Active Help https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1482. With active help, a program can provide some inline warnings or hints for users as they hit tab. Now, your CLIs can be even more intuitive to use!\r\n\r\nCurrently active help is only supported for bash V2 and zsh. Marc wrote a whole guide on how to do this, so make sure to give it a good read to learn how you can add this to your cobra code! https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/active_help.md\r\n\r\n## Group flags \ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffc \r\n\r\nCobra now has the ability to mark flags as required or exclusive as a **_group_**. Shout out to our newest maintainer @johnSchnake for this! https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1654 Let's say you have a `username` flag that _**MUST**_ be partnered with a `password` flag. Well, now, you can enforce those as being required together:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nrootCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&u, \"username\", \"u\", \"\", \"Username (required if password is set)\")\r\nrootCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&pw, \"password\", \"p\", \"\", \"Password (required if username is set)\")\r\nrootCmd.MarkFlagsRequiredTogether(\"username\", \"password\")\r\n``` \r\n\r\nFlags may also be marked as \"mutally exclusive\" with the `MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive(string, string ... )` command API. Refer to our [user guide documentation](https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/user_guide.md) for further info!\r\n\r\n## Completions \ud83d\udc40 \r\n* Add backwards-compatibility tests for legacyArgs() by @marckhouzam in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1547\r\n* feat: Add how to load completions in your current zsh session by @ondrejsika in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1608\r\n* Introduce FixedCompletions by @emersion in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1574\r\n* Add shell completion to flag groups by @marckhouzam in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1659\r\n* Modify brew prefix path in macOS system by @imxw in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1719\r\n* perf(bash-v2): use backslash escape string expansion for tab by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1682\r\n* style(bash-v2): out is not an array variable, do not refer to it as such by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1681\r\n* perf(bash-v2): standard completion optimizations by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1683\r\n* style(bash): out is not an array variable, do not refer to it as such by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1684\r\n* perf(bash-v2): short-circuit descriptionless candidate lists by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1686\r\n* perf(bash-v2): speed up filtering entries with descriptions by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1689\r\n* perf(bash-v2): speed up filtering menu-complete descriptions by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1692\r\n* fix(bash-v2): skip empty completions when filtering descriptions by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1691\r\n* perf(bash-v2): read directly to COMPREPLY on descriptionless short circuit by @scop in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1700\r\n* fix: Don't complete _command on zsh by @twpayne in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1690\r\n* Improve fish_completions code quality by @t29kida in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1515\r\n* Fix handling of descriptions for bash v3 by @marckhouzam in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1735\r\n* undefined or nil Args default to ArbitraryArgs by @umarcor in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1612\r\n* Add Command.SetContext by @joshcarp in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1551\r\n* Wrap printf tab with quotes by @PapaCharlie in https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1665\r\n\r\n## Documentation \ud83d\udcdd\r\n* Fixed typos in completions docs -

    "body": "# Winter 2022 Release \u2744\ufe0f \r\n\r\nAnother season, another release!\r\n\r\n## Goodbye viper! \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\ude80\r\n\r\nThe core Cobra library no longer requires Viper and all of its indirect dependencies. This means that Cobra's dependency tree has been drastically thinned! The Viper dependency was included because of the `cobra` CLI generation tool. [This tool has migrated to `spf13/cobra-cli`](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli/releases/tag/v1.3.0).\r\n\r\nIt's _pretty unlikely_ you were importing and using **the bootstrapping CLI tool** as part of your application (after all, it's just a tool to get going with core `cobra`).\r\n\r\nBut if you were, replace occurrences of\r\n```\r\n\"github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra\"\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\n\"github.com/spf13/cobra-cli\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in your `go.mod`, you'll want to also include this dependency:\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/spf13/cobra-cli v1.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, the maintainers _do not anticipate_ this being a breaking change to users of the core `cobra` library, so minimal work should be required for users to integrate with this new release. Moreover, this means the dependency tree for your application using Cobra should no longer require dependencies that were inherited from Viper. Huzzah! \ud83e\udd73 \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to read more\r\n- issue: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/issues/1597\r\n- PR: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1604\r\n\r\n## Documentation \ud83d\udcdd \r\n- Update Go Doc link and badge in README: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1593\r\n- Fix to install command, now targets `@latest`: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1576\r\n- Added MAINTAINERS file: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1545\r\n\r\n## Other \ud83d\udcad \r\n- Bumped license year to 2022 in golden files: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1575\r\n- Added Pixie to projects: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1581\r\n- Updated labeler for new labeling scheme: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1613 & syntax fix: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1624\r\n\r\n\r\nShoutout to our awesome contributors helping to make this cobra release possible!!\r\n@spf13 @marckhouzam @johnSchnake @jpmcb @liggitt @umarcor @hiljusti @marians @shyim @htroisi ",

Thanks to everyone for trying it, giving feedback, and providing numerous fixes! Continue to work with the new model as the old one (as noted in code comments) will be deprecated in a coming release. \r\n\r\n- `DisableFlagParsing` now triggers custom completions for flag names #1161\r\n- Fixed unbound variables in bash completions causing edge case errors #1321 \r\n- `help` completion formatting improvements & fixes #1444 \r\n- All completions now follow the `help` example: short desc are now capitalized and removes extra spacing from long description #1455 \r\n- Typo fixes in bash & zsh completions #1459 \r\n- Fixed mixed tab/spaces indentation in completion scripts. Now just 4 spaces #1473 \r\n- Support for different bash completion options. Bash completions v2 supports descriptions and requires descriptions to be removed for `menu-complete`, `menu-complete-backward` and `insert-completions`. These descriptions are now purposefully removed in support of this model. #1509 \r\n- Fix for invalid shell completions when using `~/.cobra.yaml`. Log message `Using config file: ~/.cobra.yaml` now printed to stderr #1510 \r\n- Removes unnecessary trailing spaces from completion command descriptions #1520 \r\n- Option to hide default `completion` command #1541 \r\n- Remove `__complete` command for programs without subcommands #1563\r\n\r\n## Generator changes \u2699\ufe0f \r\n\r\nThanks to @spf13 for providing a number of changes to the Cobra generator tool, streamlining it for new users!\r\n\r\n- The Cobra generator now _won't_ automatically include Viper and cleans up a number of unused imports when not using Viper.\r\n- The Cobra generator's default license is now `none`\r\n- The Cobra generator now works with Go modules\r\n- Documentation to reflect these changes\r\n\r\n## New Features \u2b50  \r\n- License can be specified by their SPDX identifiers #1159\r\n- `MatchAll` allows combining several PositionalArgs to work in concert. This now allows for enabling composing `PositionalArgs` #896\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes \ud83d\udc1b \r\n- Fixed multiple error message from cobra `init` boilerplates #1463 #1552 #1557\r\n\r\n## Testing \ud83d\udc40 \r\n- Now testing golang 1.16.x and 1.17.x in CI #1425 \r\n- Fix for running diff test to ignore CR for windows #949 \r\n- Added helper functions and reduced code reproduction in `args_test` #1426\r\n- Now using official `golangci-lint` github action #1477 \r\n\r\n## Security \ud83d\udd0f \r\n- Added GitHub dependabot #1427\r\n- Now using Viper `v1.10.0`\r\n  - There is a known CVE in an *indirect* dependency from `viper`: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/issues/1538. This will be patched in a future release\r\n\r\n## Documentation \ud83d\udcdd \r\n- Multiple projects added to the `projects_using_cobra.md` file: #1377 #1501 #1454 \r\n- Removed ToC from main readme file as it is now automagically displayed by GitHub #1429\r\n- Documentation correct for when the `--author` flag is specified #1009 \r\n- `shell_completions.md` has an easier to use snippet for copying and pasting shell completions #1372\r\n\r\n## Other \ud83d\udcad \r\n- Bump version of  `cpuguy83/go-md2man` to v2.0.1 #1460\r\n- Removed `lesser` typo from the GPL-2.0 license #880 \r\n- Fixed spelling errors #1514 \r\n\r\n_Thank you to all our amazing contributors_ \u2b50\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\ude80",

    "body": "# :stars: v1.2.0 - The completions release\r\n\r\nWelcome to v1.2.0 of Cobra! This release focuses on code completions, several critical bug fixes, some documentation updates, and security bumps. Upgrading should be simple but please take note of the introduction of bash completions V2 and their default use. The v1 completions library is still available, but will be _deprecated_ in the future. Please open an issue with any problems!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## New Features \r\n- Automatically adds a `completion` command for shell completions. If a `completion` command is already provided, uses that instead. This will _automatically_ provide shell completions for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell  https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1192\r\n    - Users can configure the command auto creation:\r\n        - disable the creation of the completion command\r\n        - disable completion descriptions\r\n        - disable the `--no-descriptions` flag for \"always on\" completion descriptions\r\n- Introduction of bash completions V2, a uniform completion approach which include completion descriptions. The V1 bash completions are still available _but will be deprecated_ in a later release - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1146\r\n    - Note that projects providing completion through a different command name (say a command named \"complete\") will continue to use v1 for their own command but will also provide cobra's implicit \"completion\" command which will use v2, unless of course, these projects take the time to disable the default \"completion\" command as noted above.\r\n- Commands now support context being passed to completions - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1265\r\n    - An example can be found here: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1265#issuecomment-734551031\r\n- Removed dependency on`mitchellh/go-homedir` in favor of core Go `os.UserHomeDir()` - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/commit/8eaca5f0f49ad747a0722d39dca7a75c34abd21a\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Fix trailing whitespace not being handled in powershell completion scripts https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1342\r\n- Bash completion variable leak fix https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1352\r\n- Fish shell completions correctly ignore trailing empty lines https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1284\r\n- PowerShell completions fix for \"no file comp directive\" - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1363\r\n- Custom completions now correctly handle multiple shorthand flags together - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1258\r\n- zsh completions now correctly handle `ShellDirectiveCompletionNoSpace` and file completion all the time - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1213\r\n- Multiple fixes / improvements to the fish shell support - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1249\r\n- Fix home directory config not loading correctly - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1282\r\n- Fix for `RegisterFlagCompletionFunc` as a global var not working in multi-threaded programs: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1423\r\n-  Custom completions correctly do not complete flags after args when interspersed is false #1308 \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Deprecated Travis CI. Now fully using Github Actions - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/commit/d0f318d45bdb46e3c1bc314c6096674426f1a620\r\n- Added test cases and enhancements (thank you to everyone for taking the time to add tests to your PRs!)\r\n- Shoutout to @marckhouzam and @Luap99 for their hard work on a cobra command completions testing library. [Check out the repo here!](https://github.com/marckhouzam/cobra-completion-testing)\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n- Bump viper to 1.8.1. This corrects several issues with vulnerabilities existing in the dependency tree - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1433\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n- Add PR labeler with pull_request_target to enable tests to run from forks - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1338\r\n- CI using MSYS2 windows machines pull latest - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1366\r\n- Multiple small fixes to spelling / documentation - https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1349 https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1417 https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1434\r\n\r\n*_Thank you to _all_ our amazing contributors :snake::rocket:_*\r\n",
