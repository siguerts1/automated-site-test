If you want to replicated multiple signatures for a subject image,  please using oci-1.1 mode(cosign v2.2.1+) for signing.\r\n- [known issue #20565](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20565) Issue with SBOM generation in Harbor v2.11.0 when using external Reverse Proxy (HTTP 404)\r\n- [known issue #20691](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/issues/20691) LDAP handshake failure with LDAP server has old TLS_RSA_* cipher suites. Workaround: add env variable GODEBUG=\"tlsrsakex=1\"  to common/config/core/env file and restart Harbor.\r\n## Tips\r\n - [Best practice](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Harbor-FAQs#notation-signature-accessory) for image singing with [Notation v1.2.0 ](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.2.0-alpha.1) in Harbor \r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Exciting New Features \ud83c\udf89\r\n#### SBOM Generation and Management\r\n Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.\r\n> When `Automatically generate SBOM on push` is enabled and there are massive concurrent push to that project, users may need to enable asynchronously updating project quota by setting `core.quotaUpdateProvider: redis` (values.yaml for harbor-helm) or setting [core.quota_update_provider: redis](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/v2.11.0/make/harbor.yml.tmpl#L316) (`harbor.yml` for installation via docker-compose) so that it can reduce the overall resource consumption, like db connection, cpu usage and memory usage.\r\n\r\n#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 \ud83c\udf89\r\nHarbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)\r\n\r\n#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry\r\nUsers can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.\r\n\r\n#### Korean UI Translation\r\nThe user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enhancement \ud83d\ude80\r\n* skip transaction for POST /service/token by @liubin in

Even if it is a public project in GitLab registry, a user has to be a member of that project and then performs replication. Affected versions are v2.10.x, v2.9.x.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Exciting New Features \ud83c\udf89\r\n#### SBOM Generation and Management:\r\n Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically.

Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)\r\n\r\n#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry: \r\nUsers can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.\r\n\r\n#### Korean UI Translation: \r\nThe user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enhancement \ud83d\ude80\r\n* skip transaction for POST /service/token by

Even if it is a public project in GitLab registry, a user has to be a member of that project and then performs replication. Affected versions are v2.10.x, v2.9.x.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Exciting New Features \ud83c\udf89\r\n#### SBOM Generation and Management:\r\n Harbor now provides robust support for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) either manually or automatically. Users can conveniently view, download, and replicate SBOMs across different instances of Harbor.\r\n\r\n#### Supporting OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 \ud83c\udf89\r\nHarbor now fully supports [OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)\r\n\r\n#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry: \r\nUsers can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.\r\n\r\n#### Korean UI Translation: \r\nThe user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enhancement \ud83d\ude80\r\n* skip transaction for POST /service/token by

Distribution Spec v1.1.0](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/v1.1.0)\r\n\r\n#### Integration with VolcEngine Registry: \r\n  Users can now seamlessly replicate images to and from the VolcEngine registry, enhancing interoperability and flexibility within the Harbor ecosystem.\r\n\r\n#### Korean UI Translation: \r\n  The user interface of Harbor has been enriched with the addition of Korean language support, ensuring a more inclusive and accessible experience for Korean-speaking users.\r\n\r\n### Enhancement \ud83d\ude80\r\n* skip transaction for POST /service/token by
