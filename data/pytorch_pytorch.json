This release features multiple improvements for PT2: `torch.compile` can now be used with Python 3.13; new performance-related knob `torch.compiler.set_stance`; several AOTInductor enhancements. Besides the PT2 improvements, another highlight is FP16 support on X86 CPUs.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Starting with this release we are not going to publish on Conda, please see [[Announcement] Deprecating PyTorch\u2019s official Anaconda channel](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/138506) for the details.\r\n\r\nFor this release the experimental Linux binaries shipped with CUDA 12.6.3 (as well as Linux Aarch64,  Linux ROCm 6.2.4, and Linux XPU binaries) are built with CXX11_ABI=1 and are [using the Manylinux 2.28 build platform](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-linux-wheels-switching-to-new-wheel-build-platform-manylinux-2-28-on-november-12-2024/2581). If you build PyTorch extensions with custom C++ or CUDA extensions, please update these builds to use CXX_ABI=1 as well and report any issues you are seeing. For the next PyTorch 2.7 release we plan to switch all Linux builds to Manylinux 2.28 and CXX11_ABI=1, please see [[RFC] PyTorch next wheel build platform: manylinux-2.28](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/123649) for the details and discussion.\r\n\r\nAlso in this release as an important security improvement measure we have changed the default value for `weights_only` parameter of `torch.load`. This is a backward compatibility-breaking change, please see [this forum post](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/bc-breaking-change-torch-load-is-being-flipped-to-use-weights-only-true-by-default-in-the-nightlies-after-137602/2573) for more details.\r\n\r\nThis release is composed of 3892 commits from 520 contributors since PyTorch 2.5. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve PyTorch. More information about how to get started with the PyTorch 2-series can be found at our [Getting Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/) page.\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>Beta\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Prototype\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>torch.compiler.set_stance\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Improved PyTorch user experience on Intel GPUs\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>torch.library.triton_op\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>FlexAttention support on X86 CPU for LLMs\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>torch.compile support for Python 3.13\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Dim.AUTO\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>New packaging APIs for AOTInductor\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>CUTLASS and CK GEMM/CONV Backends for AOTInductor\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>AOTInductor: minifier\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>AOTInductor: ABI-compatible mode code generation\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>FP16 support for X86 CPUs\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*To see a full list of public feature submissions click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TzGkWuUMF1yTe88adz1dt2mzbIsZLd3PBasy588VWgk/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n\r\n### BETA FEATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n#### **[Beta] torch.compiler.set_stance**\r\n\r\nThis feature enables the user to specify different behaviors (\u201cstances\u201d) that `torch.compile` can take between different invocations of compiled functions. One of the stances, for example, is \r\n\r\n\u201ceager_on_recompile\u201d, that instructs PyTorch to code eagerly when a recompile is necessary, reusing cached compiled code when possible.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to the [set_stance documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/2.6/generated/torch.compiler.set_stance.html#torch.compiler.set_stance) and the [Dynamic Compilation Control with torch.compiler.set_stance](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/torch_compiler_set_stance_tutorial.html) tutorial.\r\n\r\n**[Beta] torch.library.triton_op**\r\n\r\n`torch.library.triton_op` offers a standard way of creating custom operators that are backed by user-defined triton kernels. \r\n\r\nWhen users turn user-defined triton kernels into custom operators, `torch.library.triton_op` allows `torch.compile` to peek into the implementation, enabling `torch.compile` to optimize the triton kernel inside it.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to the [triton_op documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/2.6/library.html#torch.library.triton_op) and the[ Using User-Defined Triton Kernels with torch.compile](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/torch_compile_user_defined_triton_kernel_tutorial.html) tutorial.\r\n\r\n**[Beta] torch.compile support for Python 3.13**\r\n\r\n`torch.compile` previously only supported Python up to version 3.12. Users can now optimize models with `torch.compile` in Python 3.13. \r\n\r\n**[Beta] New packaging APIs for AOTInductor**\r\n\r\nA new package format, \u201c[PT2 archive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQ4cmywilnFUT1VE-4oTGxwXdc8vowCSZsrRgo3wFA8/edit?usp=sharing)\u201d, has been introduced. This essentially contains a zipfile of all the files that need to be used by AOTInductor, and allows users to send everything needed to other environments. There is also functionality to package multiple models into one artifact, and to store additional metadata inside of the package.\r\n\r\nFor more details please see the updated [torch.export AOTInductor Tutorial for Python runtime](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/torch_export_aoti_python.html).\r\n\r\n**[Beta] AOTInductor: minifier**\r\n\r\nIf a user encounters an error while using AOTInductor APIs, AOTInductor Minifier allows creation of a minimal nn.Module that reproduces the error.\r\n\r\nFor more information please see the [AOTInductor Minifier documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/2.6/torch.compiler_aot_inductor_minifier.html).\r\n\r\n**[Beta] AOTInductor: ABI-compatible mode code generation**\r\n\r\nAOTInductor-generated model code has dependency on Pytorch cpp libraries. As Pytorch evolves quickly, it\u2019s important to make sure previously AOTInductor compiled models can continue to run on newer Pytorch versions, i.e. AOTInductor is backward compatible. \r\n\r\nIn order to guarantee application binary interface (ABI) backward compatibility, we have carefully defined a set of stable C interfaces in libtorch and make sure AOTInductor generates code that only refers to the specific set of APIs and nothing else in libtorch. We will keep the set of C APIs stable across Pytorch versions and thus provide backward compatibility guarantees for AOTInductor-compiled models.\r\n\r\n**[Beta] FP16 support for X86 CPUs (both eager and Inductor modes)**\r\n\r\nFloat16 datatype is commonly used for reduced memory usage and faster computation in AI inference and training. CPUs like the recently launched [Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae 6 with P-Cores](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/xeon/xeon6-p-cores.html) support Float16 datatype with native accelerator [AMX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/advanced-matrix-extensions/overview.html). Float16 support on X86 CPUs was introduced in PyTorch 2.5 as a prototype feature, and now it has been further improved for both eager mode and Torch.compile + Inductor mode, making it Beta level feature with both functionality and performance verified with a broad scope of workloads.\r\n\r\n\r\n### PROTOTYPE FEATURES\r\n\r\n**[Prototype] Improved PyTorch user experience on Intel GPUs**\r\n\r\nPyTorch user experience on Intel GPUs is further improved with simplified installation steps, Windows release binary distribution and expanded coverage of supported GPU models including the latest Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 B-Series discrete graphics. Application developers and researchers seeking to fine-tune, inference and develop with PyTorch models on [Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra AI PCs ](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core-ultra/ai-pc.html)and [Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 discrete graphics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/arc.html) will now be able to directly install PyTorch with binary releases for Windows, Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Simplified Intel GPU software stack setup to enable one-click installation of the torch-xpu PIP wheels to run deep learning workloads in an out of the box fashion, eliminating the complexity of installing and activating Intel GPU development software bundles.\r\n* Windows binary releases for torch core, torchvision and torchaudio have been made available for Intel GPUs, and the supported GPU models have been expanded from Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra Processors with Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 Graphics, [Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra Series 2 with Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 Graphics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/processors/core-ultra.html) and [Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 A-Series Graphics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/desktop/a-series/overview.html) to the latest GPU hardware [Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 B-Series graphics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/desktop/b-series/overview.html).\r\n* Further enhanced coverage of Aten operators on Intel GPUs with SYCL* kernels for smooth eager mode execution, as well as bug fixes and performance optimizations for torch.compile on Intel GPUs.\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding Intel GPU support, please refer to [Getting Started Guide](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html).\r\n\r\n**[Prototype] FlexAttention support on X86 CPU for LLMs**\r\n\r\nFlexAttention was initially introduced in PyTorch 2.5 to provide optimized implementations for Attention variants with a flexible API. In PyTorch 2.6, X86 CPU support for FlexAttention was added through TorchInductor CPP backend. This new feature leverages and extends current CPP template abilities to support broad attention variants (e.x.: PageAttention, which is critical for LLMs inference) based on the existing FlexAttention API, and brings optimized performance on x86 CPUs. With this feature, it\u2019s easy to use FlexAttention API to compose Attention solutions on CPU platforms and achieve good performance.\r\n\r\n**[Prototype] Dim.AUTO**\r\n\r\n`Dim.AUTO` allows usage of automatic dynamic shapes with `torch.export`. Users can export with `Dim.AUTO `and \u201cdiscover\u201d the dynamic behavior of their models, with min/max ranges, relations between dimensions, and static/dynamic behavior being automatically inferred.\r\n\r\nThis is a more user-friendly experience compared to the existing named-Dims approach for specifying dynamic shapes, which requires the user to fully understand the dynamic behavior of their models at export time. `Dim.AUTO` allows users to write generic code that isn\u2019t model-dependent, increasing ease-of-use for exporting with dynamic shapes.\r\n\r\nPlease see [torch.export tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_export_tutorial.html#constraints-dynamic-shapes) for more information.\r\n\r\n**[Prototype] CUTLASS and CK GEMM/CONV Backends for AOTInductor**\r\n\r\nThe CUTLASS and CK backend adds kernel choices for GEMM autotuning in Inductor. This is now also available in AOTInductor which can run in C++ runtime environments. A major improvement to the two backends is improved compile-time speed by eliminating redundant kernel binary compilations and dynamic shapes support.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Tracked Regressions**\r\n\r\n### torch.device(0) makes CUDA init fail in subprocess \r\n\r\nThere is a known regression (#144152) that `torch.device(0)` makes CUDA init fail in subprocess since PyTorch 2.5.0.\r\nThere was an attempt to fix the regressions, but it caused some complications and was reverted.\r\n\r\nAn easy workaround is to use `torch.device('cuda')` or `torch.device('cuda:0')` instead.\r\n\r\n### Regression in the compilation of the torch.all operation with out= variant\r\n\r\nA regressions (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/145220) was reported for PyTorch 2.6.0 with \r\ncompilation of the `out=` variant of the `torch.all` operator. This should be a rare use case, a workaround can be\r\nrewriting the model code to avoid the `out=` variant.\r\n\r\n## **Backwards Incompatible changes**\r\n\r\n### Flip default torch.load to weights_only ([#137602](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/137602), [#138225](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/138225), [#138866](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/138866), [#139221](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139221), [#140304](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140304), [#138936](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/138936), [#139541](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139541), [#140738](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140738), [#142153](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/142153), [#139433](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139433))\r\n\r\nWe are closing the loop on the deprecation that started in 2.4 and flipped `torch.load` to use `weights_only=True` by default.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this flag is set, instead of using the usual pickle module, `torch.load` uses a custom unpickler constrained to call only functions and classes needed for loading state dictionaries and basic types.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this change is disruptive for users serializing more than basic types, we expect the increased security by default is a tradeoff that is worth it. Do note that, even though this default is safer, we still recommend only loading trusted checkpoints and rely on more constrained (and even safer) formats like [safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) for un-trusted checkpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor full details, please refer to [this dev-discuss post](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/bc-breaking-change-torch-load-is-being-flipped-to-use-weights-only-true-by-default-in-the-nightlies-after-137602/2573).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anaconda deprecation in CD. Remove anaconda dependency in Magma builds ([#141024](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141024)) ([#141281](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141281)) ([#140157](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140157)) ([#139888](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139888)) ([#140141](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140141))  ([#139924](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139924)) ([#140158](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140158)) ([#142019](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/142019))  ([#142276](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/142276)) ([#142277](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/142277))  ([#142282](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/142282))\r\n\r\nPyTorch will stop publishing Anaconda packages that depend on Anaconda\u2019s default packages. We are directing users to utilize our official wheel packages from download.pytorch.org or PyPI, or switch to utilizing conda-forge (pytorch) packages if they would like to continue to use conda. For more details refer to [this announcement](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/138506)\r\n\r\n### Added Manylinux 2.28 prototype support and CXX11_ABI=1 for following binaries: Linux CUDA 12.6, Linux aarch64 CPU, Linux aarch64 GPU CUDA 12.6, ROCm 6.2.4, Linux XPU  ([#139894](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139894)) ([#139631](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139631)) ([#139636](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139636)) ([#140743](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140743)) ([#137696](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/137696)) ([#141565](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141565)) ([#140681](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140681)) ([#141609](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141609)) ([#141704](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141704)) ([#141423](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141423)) ([#141609](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141609))\r\n\r\nThe PyTorch binaries shipped with CUDA 12.6.3 are built with CXX11_ABI=1 and are using the Manylinux 2.28 build platform. If you are building PyTorch extensions with custom C++ or CUDA extensions, please update these builds to use CXX_ABI=1 as well and report any issues you are seeing. For the next PyTorch 2.7 release we plan to switch all Linux builds to Manylinux 2.28 and CXX11_ABI=1, please see [[RFC] PyTorch next wheel build platform: manylinux-2.28](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/123649) for the details and discussion.\r\n\r\n### ONNX\r\n\r\n\r\n#### `torch.onnx.export(..., dynamo=True)` now creates ONNX models using IR version 10 ([#141207](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141207)) \r\n\r\nONNX ir_version=10 is used to add support for UINT4, INT4 data types and include metadata in GraphProto and NodeProto. Make sure model consumers are able to accept IR version 10 ONNX models. You may read more about IRv10 on https://github.com/onnx/onnx/releases/tag/v1.16.0.\r\n\r\n#### Several obsolete APIs are removed ([#133825, #136279, #137789, #137790](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/133825)) \r\n\r\nSome logging APIs, `torch.onnx.ExportTypes`, `torch.onnx.export_to_pretty_string` are removed.

However, this does not have a great user experience as actually there are other files that are used along with the .so, for example .cubin files and serialized extern kernels. So, we introduce a new package format, \u201c[PT2 archive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RQ4cmywilnFUT1VE-4oTGxwXdc8vowCSZsrRgo3wFA8/edit#heading=h.v2y2jgnwc56a)\u201d, which is what we intend to have AOTInductor return. This essentially contains a zipfile of all the files that need to be used by AOTInductor, and allows users to send to other environments. There is also functionality to package multiple models into one artifact, and to store additional metadata inside of the package.\r\n* [AOTInductor Minifier](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/torch.compiler_aot_inductor_minifier.html). If you encounter an error while using AOT Inductor APIs such as `torch._inductor.aoti_compile_and_package`, `torch._indcutor.aoti_load_package`, or running the loaded model of aoti_load_package on some inputs, you can use the AOTInductor Minifier to create a minimal nn.Module that reproduces the error.

In order to guarantee ABI backward compatibility, we have carefully defined a set of stable C interfaces in libtorch and make sure AOTInductor generates code that only refers to the specific set of APIs and nothing else in libtorch. We will keep the set of C APIs stable across Pytorch versions and thus provide BC guarantees for AOTInductor-compiled models.\r\n* `export.export_for_inference` and `export.exported_program.core_aten_decompositions` API. `export_for_inference` returns a functional, post-dispatch ATen IR. ([#135912](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/135912)).\r\n\r\n### Inductor\r\n\r\n* Move stack allocation related configs in AOTI ([#139093](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139093)). All stack allocation related configs now have a aot_inductor prefix, so `torch.compile(options={\"use_minimal_arrayref_interface\": True})(foo)` is now `torch.compile(options={\"aot_inductor.use_minimal_arrayref_interface\": True})(foo)` and `torch.compile(options={\"allow_stack_allocation\": True})(foo)` is now `torch.compile(options={\"aot_inductor.allow_stack_allocation\": True})(foo)`.\r\n* Move `torch._utils.is_compiling` to `torch.compiler.is_compiling` ([#127690](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/127690)) Rewrite `torch._utils.is_compiling()` to `torch.compiler.is_compiling()`.\r\n* Added option `\u200b\u200bautotune_num_choices_displayed` to control number of kernel options displayed ([#138788](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/138788))\r\n* Added option `force_pointwise_cat` concat support through inductor using pointwise kernels ([#141966](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141966)). This forces concat to be generated as a pointwise op with masked loads.\r\n* New config option `annotate_training` that adds Inductor annotations to NVTX.  ([#130429](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/130429))\r\n* Introduces an option `triton_kernel_default_layout_constraint` to tweak stride settings for user-defined Triton kernels, enhancing customization and flexibility ([#135530](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/135530)).\r\n* User can patch inductor config to enable strict custom kernel layout constraints by changing `torch.compile(options={\"triton_kernel_default_layout_constraint\": \"needs_fixed_stride_order\"})(foo)` ([#135581](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/135581)). \r\n* External callable registration API `register_external_matmul` for Matmul tuning candidates in Inductor ([#130774](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/130774)).\r\n* Adds support for Windows Arm64 to enhance platform compatibility ([#133088](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/133088)).\r\n* Integrates support for AMD triton stream pipeliner in ROCm to enhance performance ([#139881](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/139881)).\r\n* Adds support for TRITON_INTERPRET in Inductor ([#140841](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140841)).\r\n* Adds update_constant_buffer pybind support in AOTInductor ([#140755](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/140755)).\r\n* Provides an option `package_constants_in_so` to exclude weights from .so files in AOTInductor ([#141997](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/141997)).\r\n* Adds `load_constants` to the package API ([#142246](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/142246)).\r\n* Enables auto functionalize v2 by default ([#136685](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/136685)).\r\n* Adds raise_error_on_ignored_optimization to the aoti config ([#138035](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/138035)).\r\n* Adds stats summary (mean/min/max, etc) for jit inductor tensor value printing ([#135887](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/135887)).\r\n\r\n\r\n### ONNX\r\n\r\n* Models using `torch.cond` is supported ([#137428](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/137428))\r\n\r\n`torch.cond` is the recommended way to introduce control flows that can be converted to an ONNX model.\r\n\r\n* Users can provide a `custom_translation_table` to provide custom implementations for converting operators to ONNX ([#135403](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/135403))\r\n\r\nThis is useful when you need to override an implementation or provide one that is not currently implemented.

This release features a new CuDNN backend for SDPA, enabling speedups by default for users of SDPA on H100s or newer GPUs. As well, regional compilation of torch.compile offers a way to reduce the cold start up time for torch.compile by allowing users to compile a repeated nn.Module (e.g. a transformer layer in LLM) without recompilations. Finally, TorchInductor CPP backend offers solid performance speedup with numerous enhancements like FP16 support, CPP wrapper, AOT-Inductor mode, and max-autotune mode.\r\nThis release is composed of 4095 commits from 504 contributors since PyTorch 2.4. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.5. More information about how to get started with the PyTorch 2-series can be found at our [Getting Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/) page.\r\nAs well, please check out our new ecosystem projects releases with [TorchRec](https://github.com/pytorch/torchrec) and [TorchFix](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/torchfix/releases/tag/v0.6.0).\r\n\r\n| Beta | Prototype |\r\n|------|-----------|\r\n| CuDNN backend for SDPA | FlexAttention |\r\n| torch.compile regional compilation without recompilations | Compiled Autograd |\r\n| TorchDynamo added support for exception handling & MutableMapping types | Flight Recorder |\r\n| TorchInductor CPU backend optimization | Max-autotune Support on CPU with GEMM Template |\r\n| | TorchInductor on Windows |\r\n| | FP16 support on CPU path for both eager mode and TorchInductor CPP backend |\r\n| | Autoload Device Extension |\r\n| | Enhanced Intel GPU support |\r\n\r\n*To see a full list of public feature submissions click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TzGkWuUMF1yTe88adz1dt2mzbIsZLd3PBasy588VWgk/edit?gid=949287277#gid=949287277).\r\n\r\n### BETA FEATURES\r\n#### [Beta] CuDNN backend for SDPA\r\nThe cuDNN \"Fused Flash Attention\" backend  was landed for `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention`. On NVIDIA H100 GPUs this can provide up to 75% speed-up over FlashAttentionV2. This speedup is enabled by default for all users of SDPA on H100 or newer GPUs.\r\n#### [Beta] _torch.compile_ regional compilation without recompilations\r\nRegional compilation without recompilations, via `torch._dynamo.config.inline_inbuilt_nn_modules` which default to True in 2.5+. This option allows users to compile a repeated nn.Module (e.g. a transformer layer in LLM) without recompilations. Compared to compiling the full model, this option can result in smaller compilation latencies with 1%-5% performance degradation compared to full model compilation.\r\n\r\nSee the [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/regional_compilation.html) for more information.\r\n#### [Beta] TorchInductor CPU backend optimization\r\nThis feature advances Inductor\u2019s CPU backend optimization, including CPP backend code generation and FX fusions with customized CPU kernels. The Inductor CPU backend supports vectorization of common data types and all Inductor IR operations, along with the static and symbolic shapes. It is compatible with both Linux and Windows OS and supports the default Python wrapper, the CPP wrapper, and AOT-Inductor mode. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it extends the max-autotune mode of the GEMM template (prototyped in 2.5), offering further performance gains. The backend supports various FX fusions, lowering to customized kernels such as oneDNN for Linear/Conv operations and SDPA. The Inductor CPU backend consistently achieves performance speedups across three benchmark suites\u2014TorchBench, Hugging Face, and timms\u2014outperforming eager mode in 97.5% of the 193 models tested.\r\n\r\n### PROTOTYPE FEATURES\r\n#### [Prototype] FlexAttention\r\nWe've introduced a flexible API that enables implementing various attention mechanisms such as Sliding Window, Causal Mask, and PrefixLM with just a few lines of idiomatic PyTorch code. This API leverages torch.compile to generate a fused FlashAttention kernel, which eliminates extra memory allocation and achieves performance comparable to handwritten implementations. Additionally, we automatically generate the backwards pass using PyTorch's autograd machinery. Furthermore, our API can take advantage of sparsity in the attention mask, resulting in significant improvements over standard attention implementations.\r\n\r\nFor more information and examples, please refer to the [official blog post](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention/) and [Attention Gym](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/attention-gym).\r\n#### [Prototype] Compiled Autograd\r\nCompiled Autograd is an extension to the PT2 stack allowing the capture of the entire backward pass. Unlike the backward graph traced by AOT dispatcher, Compiled Autograd tracing is deferred until backward execution time, which makes it impervious to forward pass graph breaks, and allows it to record backward hooks into the graph.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/compiled_autograd_tutorial.html) for more information.\r\n#### [Prototype] Flight Recorder\r\nFlight recorder is a new debugging tool that helps debug stuck jobs. The tool works by continuously capturing information about collectives as they run. Upon detecting a stuck job, the information can be used to quickly identify misbehaving ranks/machines along with code stack traces.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to the following [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/flight_recorder_tutorial.html).\r\n#### [Prototype] Max-autotune Support on CPU with GEMM Template\r\nMax-autotune mode for the Inductor CPU backend in torch.compile profiles multiple implementations of operations at compile time and selects the best-performing one. This is particularly beneficial for GEMM-related operations, using a C++ template-based GEMM implementation as an alternative to the ATen-based approach with oneDNN and MKL libraries. We support FP32, BF16, FP16, and INT8 with epilogue fusions for x86 CPUs. We\u2019ve seen up to 7% geomean speedup on the dynamo benchmark suites and up to 20% boost in next-token latency for LLM inference.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to the [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/max_autotune_on_CPU_tutorial.html).\r\n#### [Prototype] TorchInductor CPU on Windows\r\nInductor CPU backend in torch.compile now works on Windows. We support MSVC (cl), clang (clang-cl) and Intel compiler (icx-cl) for Windows inductor currently.\r\n\r\nSee the [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/inductor_windows_cpu.html) for more details.\r\n#### [Prototype] FP16 support on CPU path for both eager mode and TorchInductor CPP backend\r\nFloat16 is a commonly used reduced floating point type for performance improvement in neural network inference/training. Since this release, float16 for both eager and TorchInductor is supported on the CPU path.\r\n#### [Prototype] Autoload Device Extension\r\nPyTorch now supports autoloading for out-of-tree device extensions, streamlining integration by eliminating the need for manual imports. This feature, enabled through the torch.backends entrypoint, simplifies usage by ensuring seamless extension loading, while allowing users to disable it via an environment variable if needed.\r\n\r\nSee the [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/python_extension_autoload.html) for more information.\r\n#### [Prototype] Enhanced Intel GPU support\r\nIntel GPUs support enhancement is now available for both Intel\u00ae Data Center GPU Max Series and Intel\u00ae Client GPUs (Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors with built-in Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 graphics and Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 Graphics for dGPU parts), which is to make it easier to accelerate your Machine Learning workflows on Intel GPUs in PyTorch 2.5 release. We also enabled the initial support of PyTorch on Windows for Intel\u00ae Client GPUs in this release.\r\n- Expanded PyTorch hardware backend support matrix to include both Intel Data Center and Client GPUs.\u202f\u202f \r\n- The implementation of SYCL* kernels to enhance coverage and execution of Aten operators on Intel GPUs to boost performance in PyTorch eager mode. \r\n- Enhanced Intel GPU backend of torch.compile to improve inference and training performance for a wide range of deep learning workloads.  \r\n\r\nThese features are available through PyTorch preview and nightly binary PIP wheels. For more information regarding Intel GPU support, please refer to [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/get_start_xpu.html).\r\n\r\n## Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n### Distributed\r\n\r\n- [c10d] Remove Option for ProcessGroup and Expose backend Options to reflect the correct code structure (#132931)\r\n  - We released Dispatchable collectives in 2.0 and we will use Backend Option for Backend initialization and the PG options are not needed any more.\r\n  - In 2.4 and before, users can do:\r\n  ```py\r\n  # Users can pass in a basic option when creating an instance of ProcessGroup\r\n  base_pg_options = ProcessGroup.Options(backend=str(backend))\r\n  base_pg_options._timeout = timeout\r\n\r\n  pg: ProcessGroup = ProcessGroup(\r\n    store, rank, group_size, base_pg_options\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  # Users then need to create a backend option to create the comm backend (e.g., ProcessGroupNCCL)\r\n  pg_options = ProcessGroupNCCL.Options()\r\n  backend = ProcessGroupNCCL(\r\n    store, rank, group_size, pg_options\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n  - But from 2.5 onwards, users don\u2019t need to pass in an option to create an instance of ProcessGroup and user can still set default backend for the pg since users still try to get default backend in the code:\r\n\r\n  ```py\r\n  # No basic option is passed in when creating a instance of ProcessGroup\r\n  pg: ProcessGroup = ProcessGroup(store, rank, group_size)\r\n  pg._set_default_backend(Backend.backend_type_map[backend])\r\n  # Users then need to create a backend option to create the comm backend (e.g., ProcessGroupNCCL)\r\n  pg_options = ProcessGroupNCCL.Options()\r\n  backend = ProcessGroupNCCL(\r\n    store, rank, group_size, pg_options\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Export\r\n\r\n- Remove `dynamic_dim()` (#134211)  \r\n  - The `dynamic_dim()` method for specifying dynamic shapes in `torch.export()` has been removed. Please refer to the [export tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torch_export_tutorial.html#constraints-dynamic-shapes) for using `Dims` to specify dynamic shapes.\r\n\r\n### Inductor\r\n\r\n- [Torch] Support meta device in checkpoint (#132684)\r\n- Switch to internal benchmarking and update benchmarking path (#132827)\r\n\r\n  This change moves from using triton\u2019s benchmarking utils to the internal inductor utils at `torch._inductor.runtime.benchmarking`. To update your benchmarking code:\r\n\r\n  ```py\r\n  # before\r\n  from torch._inductor.runtime.runtime_utils import do_bench_gpu\r\n  # ...\r\n  do_bench_gpu(kernel, rep=40, fast_flush=True)\r\n\r\n  # after\r\n  from torch._inductor.runtime.benchmarking import benchmarker\r\n  # ...\r\n  benchmarker.benchmark_gpu(kernel_call, rep=40, fast_flush=True)\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### mps\r\n\r\n- [MPS][BE] Delete MacOS-12.3 specific checks (#133141)\r\n\r\n### nn\r\n\r\n- Update fused kernels and call _safe_softmax from SDPA (#131863)  \r\n    \r\n  Before this PR, fully masked rows in the `attn_mask` passed to `nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` would yield NANs in the output, after this PR, fully masked rows yield 0s.\r\n\r\n  Example:\r\n\r\n  2.4.0\r\n\r\n  ```py \r\n  B, S, D = 1, 1, 128\r\n\r\n  q = torch.randn(B, S, D, device='cuda')  \r\n  k = torch.randn(B, S, D, device='cuda')  \r\n  v = torch.randn(B, S, D, device='cuda')\r\n\r\n  attn_mask = torch.tensor([False], device='cuda')\r\n\r\n  F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, attn_mask=attn_mask)  \r\n  tensor([[[nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan,  \r\n            nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan]]], device='cuda:0')  \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  2.5.0\r\n\r\n  ```py \r\n  B, S, D = 1, 1, 128\r\n\r\n  q = torch.randn(B, S, D, device='cuda')  \r\n  k = torch.randn(B, S, D, device='cuda')  \r\n  v = torch.randn(B, S, D, device='cuda')\r\n\r\n  attn_mask = torch.tensor([False], device='cuda')\r\n\r\n  F.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, attn_mask=attn_mask)  \r\n  tensor([[[-0., -0., 0., -0., 0., 0., -0., -0., -0., -0., 0., -0., -0., -0., 0., -0., 0., 0., -0., -0., 0., -0., -0.,  \r\n            0., 0., -0., 0., -0., -0., 0., -0., -0.]]], device='cuda:0')  \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Optimizer Frontend\r\n\r\n- Add support to `GradScaler` for respecting an already set `grad_scale` value (#123429)\r\n\r\n### Python Frontend\r\n\r\n- No more CPython 3.8 support and removal from binary (#132138)  \r\n  CPython 3.8 is now EOL and PyTorch 2.4 is the last version that is supported.  \r\n  See [https://devguide.python.org/versions/](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) for CPython EOL timelines and [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/RELEASE.md\\#python](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/RELEASE.md#python) for PyTorch\u2019s support CPython version policy.\r\n\r\n### ONNX\r\n#### Options to `torch.onnx.export` (except for the first three arguments) are now keyword-only (#131501)\r\n\r\nOptions can be supplied by keywords only to allow for future addition and evolution of the `torch.onnx.export` API.\r\n\r\nExample:  \r\nVersion 2.4  \r\n```python  \r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, input, f, True, False)  \r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion 2.5:  \r\n```python  \r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, input, f, export_params=True, verbose=False)  \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Deprecated internal API `torch.onnx._export` has been removed (133824)\r\n\r\n`torch.onnx._export` is an internal API which is not meant for public consumption. Use the public `torch.onnx.export` instead.\r\n\r\nExample:  \r\nVersion 2.4  \r\n```python  \r\ntorch.onnx._export(...)  \r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion 2.5:  \r\n```python  \r\ntorch.onnx.export(...)  \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The `op_level_debug` option from `torch.onnx.ExportOptions` has been removed (#134961)\r\n\r\nThis option, designed to identify operator discrepancies, proved unreliable and has been removed. Instead, use `torch.onnx.export(..., report=True, verify=True)` option to validate exported models.\r\n\r\n#### The `ONNXProgramSerializer` class has been removed (#135261)\r\n\r\nThe ONNX model in `torch.onnx.ONNXProgram` is now maintained and serialized by [ONNX IR](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxscript/blob/main/onnxscript/ir/README.md).  \r\n`textproto`, `onnxtext`, and `json` formats are supported by default when calling `ONNXProgram.save()` with a corresponding file extension.\r\n\r\n#### The `SymbolicContext` class has been removed (#132184)\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `torch.onnx.SymbolicContext` class has been removed. (Non-dynamo) custom symbolic functions can no longer take `ctx: torch.onnx.SymbolicContext` as the first argument.\r\n\r\n#### Support for caffe2 has been removed (#129021)\r\n\r\n- Remove Caffe2 handling from `onnx_unpack_quantized_weights` (#129021)  \r\n- Remove `is_caffe2_aten_fallback` in `torch.onnx.symbolic_helper`\r\n\r\n#### Some errors classes are removed\r\n\r\n`CheckerError` and `InvalidExportOptionsError` are removed. Users can always catch `RuntimeError` to handle torch.onnx export errors.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n### Dynamo\r\n\r\n- Remove `torch._dynamo.utils.CompileProfiler` (#135133)\r\n\r\n### Export\r\n\r\n- Deprecate `None` for specifying static dimensions in `dynamic_shapes` (#134877)<br>\r\n  The use of `None` at the dimension-level for specifying dynamic shapes is now deprecated, and a user warning will be raised, so please use `Dim.STATIC` in its place. Specifying `None` for an entire input, or an entire program, is still supported. \r\n\r\n### Inductor\r\n\r\n- aot_autograd: copy metadata from fw to bw nodes (#126573)\r\n- deprecate `search_autotune_cache` (#133628)\r\n\r\n### Releng\r\n\r\n- Deprecate Python 3.8 support from CI/CD (#133621, #133624, #135245)\r\n\r\n### ONNX\r\n\r\n#### Supplying model keyword arguments to `torch.onnx.export` is deprecated (#131501)  \r\nThe ability to supply model keyword arguments as a final dictionary is deprecated. Users should use the `kwargs` parameter instead.\r\n\r\nDeprecated:  \r\n```python  \r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, (arg1, arg2, {\u201ckwarg1\u201d: \u2026}))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFuture:  \r\n```python  \r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, (arg1, arg2), kwargs={\u201ckwarg1\u201d: \u2026})  \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### `torch.onnx.OperatorExportTypes` is deprecated (#131501)\r\n\r\nThe ability to supply `operator_export_type` in `torch.onnx.export()` is deprecated. Exported ONNX graphs will always use the ONNX opset domain. Options `ONNX_FALLTHROUGH`, `ONNX_ATEN` and `ONNX_ATEN_FALLBACK` are no longer supported. The `OperatorExportTypes` class will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n#### The `training` option in `torch.onnx.export` is deprecated\r\n\r\nSet the model training mode first before exporting instead.\r\n\r\nDeprecated:  \r\n```python  \r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, inputs, path, training=torch.onnx.TrainingMode.EVAL)  \r\n```\r\n\r\nFuture:  \r\n```python  \r\nmodel = model.eval()  \r\ntorch.onnx.export(model, inputs, path)  \r\n```\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Autograd frontend\r\n\r\n- Add selective activation checkpoint support to `torch.utils.checkpoint` (#125795, #129262)\r\n\r\n### Distributed\r\n\r\n#### Flight Recorder with an analyzer  \r\n  - Flight Recorder captures diagnostics information as collectives run- right now only for NCCL collectives. The captured diagnostic information is used to help root cause issues when jobs get stuck or timeout. An available analyzer script runs known heuristics using the collected data and attempts to automatically identify the underlying issue that caused the job to stall.

This is recommended as a replacement for `torch.onnx.dynamo_export` starting in PyTorch 2.5.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.5:  \r\n```python  \r\nonnx_program = torch.onnx.export(model, inputs, kwargs=kwargs, dynamo=True)  \r\n# Use the external_data option to save weights as external data  \r\nonnx_program.save(\u201cmodel.onnx\u201d, external_data=True)  \r\n# To save without initializers  \r\nonnx_program.save(\u201cmodel.onnx\u201d, include_initializers=False, keep_initializers_as_inputs=True)  \r\n```\r\n\r\n`torch.onnx.export(model, args, dynamo=True, report=True, verify=True)` leverages `torch.export` and [ONNX IR](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxscript/blob/main/onnxscript/ir/README.md) to convert captured `ExportedProgram`s to ONNX efficiently and robustly. This new process reduces memory consumption by half compared to `dynamo_export` in 2.4, while preserving rich tensor shape and stack trace information in the ONNX graph. You can leverage the `report=True` option to obtain a conversion report in markdown format to diagnose any conversion issues. Set `verify=True` to verify the ONNX model numerically with ONNX Runtime.\r\n\r\nWhen using `external_data=True` to save model weights as external data to the .onnx file, weights larger than 1 MB are now aligned at 64 KB addresses. This allows runtimes to memory-map weights for better memory efficiency during inference.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE]  \r\n> The `dynamo=True` option currently supports only ONNX opset 18. Future releases will expand support to newer opsets.\r\n\r\n> [NOTE]  \r\n> The `dynamo=True` option requires the latest versions of `onnxscript` and `onnx` packages.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n### Autograd frontend\r\n\r\n- Support GradientEdge as output for `torch.autograd.grad` (#127766)  \r\n- `torch.autograd.graph.increment_version` accept List[Tensor] (#132652)  \r\n- Hooks registered via `torch.autograd.graph.Node.register_hook` during Node execution are run (#134728)\r\n\r\n### Compostability\r\n\r\n#### Custom ops:\r\n\r\n- Improvements to torch.library.custom_op  \r\n  - Supported calling from a multithreaded context (#128547)  \r\n  - Improved overhead when autograd is unnecessary (#127976)  \r\n  - Made it compatible with `from __future__ import annotations` (#128809)  \r\n  - Supported string default values in schema (#129179)  \r\n  - Added better suggestions for unsupported types (#129417)  \r\n  - Added `mutates_args=\u201dunknown\u201d` for if you didn\u2019t know the alias information of your custom op (#129614)  \r\n  - Added ability to add default values for device types (#129792)  \r\n  - Added ability to construct factory functions  (#129978)  \r\n  - Added ability to temporarily disable kernels (#130190, #130406)  \r\n  - [docs] Redirect custom ops landing page to the correct place (#129177)  \r\n  - Prevented Dynamo from peeking into torch.library.{custom_op, register_kernel} (#133125)  \r\n  - Improve aliasing error message (#134688)  \r\n- Miscellaneous  \r\n  - `register_flop_formula` now actually does something for custom ops (#131777)  \r\n  - Improved torch.library.opcheck docs.

(#130843)  \r\n- The issue Lift inductor lowerings for jagged <-> padded dense kernels introduces lowerings for conversions between jagged and padded dense tensors, supporting operations like _jagged_to_padded_dense_forward and _padded_dense_to_jagged_forward. This improves PyTorch's ability to handle irregular tensor structures efficiently, particularly in tasks like natural language processing where padding is common.(#125968)  \r\n- The issue Add BackendFeature gating introduces a mechanism to gate backend features in PyTorch's inductor based on the availability of specific backend capabilities. This ensures that operations requiring specialized backend support are only enabled when those features are present, improving compatibility and stability.  (#128266)  \r\n- The issue Support additional lifted constants supplied to const folding enhances AOTInductor's constant folding by allowing additional lifted constants from graphs to be included. This update improves compatibility when using lifted graphs in constant folding processes, particularly with the split_const_gm function.  (#130743)  \r\n- The issue Compute q_num_blocks from kv_num_blocks if q_num_blocks is not passed in updates the logic in flex_attention to compute the q_num_blocks from kv_num_blocks when q_num_blocks is not explicitly provided, ensuring consistent behavior across different input configurations. (#130809)  \r\n- The issue Remove static param counting if inlining NN modules eliminates the need for static parameter counting when inlining neural network modules in the inductor backend. This simplifies the logic for handling parameters and improves performance by skipping unnecessary counting. (#130503)  \r\n- The issue Use get_reduction_combine_fn for reduction ops updates the Halide backend by introducing a function that determines how reductions are combined during computation, improving the clarity and efficiency of reduction operations in the backend. (#130212)  \r\n- The issue Use 0D scalar inputs/outputs allows the Halide backend to handle 0-dimensional scalar inputs and outputs, fixing issues related to scalar operations in the Halide integration with PyTorch. (#130129)  \r\n- The issue Change the schema of QLinear Binary modifies the schema to better support the corresponding GEMM templates, making it easier to handle autotuning by reordering tensor inputs. (#129049)  \r\n- The issue Dimension-based indexing for the halide-backend changes the indexing in the generated Halide code to be dimension-based rather than 1D-based, which resolves multiple bugs and performance issues related to indexing in PyTorch's Halide backend. (#129026)  \r\n- The issue Use _unsafe_masked_index in masked_scatter decomposition updates the masked_scatter operation by using the _unsafe_masked_index function in its decomposition, improving performance and reliability.(#123667)  \r\n- The issue Only autotune at compile time when enabled via config ensures that autotuning in AOTInductor only occurs when explicitly enabled via configuration, preventing unintended autotuning during execution unless specified. (#129413)  \r\n- The issue Adjust efficient_conv_bn_eval_graph for inlining modifies the inlining of the efficient_conv_bn_eval_graph function to improve execution during evaluation in PyTorch, particularly for built-in neural network modules. (#128878)  \r\n- The issue Make config.fx_graph_remote_cache be a three-value switch introduces a configuration option allowing fx_graph_remote_cache to be set as True, False, or None, where None disables it for OSS (open-source software) but enables internal configurations for JK. (#128628)  \r\n- Enables GraphTransformObserver for inductor backend.(#127962)\r\n\r\n### mps\r\n\r\n- [MPS] Add Metal implementation of exp op (#128421)  \r\n- [MPS] Add lu_factor in MPS (#99269)  \r\n- [MPS] Add support for autocast in MPS  (#99272)  \r\n- [MPS] Add support for autocast in MPS  (#99272)  \r\n- [MPS] Enable MPS mm from macOS >= 14.4 (#133494)  \r\n- [MPS] Add support for autocast in MPS  (#99272)  \r\n- [MPS] Add int4mm weight packing mps kernel, and improved int4mm shader (#128965)  \r\n- [MPS] Fast math env var (#129007)  \r\n- [MPS] Check and error message for no support for conv with output_channels > 2^16 (#129484)  \r\n- [MPS] Add tensor_lr overloads to fused adam & adamw (#129451)  \r\n- [MPS] Add SDPA implentation (#131362)  \r\n- [MPS] Add native implementation for shift ops (#131813)  \r\n- [MPS] Add native strided API for MPSNDArray starting with macOS 15 (#128393)\r\n\r\n### nn\r\n\r\n- Made nn.Module state_dict load_state_dict pre-hook and state_dict post-hook public (#131690)  \r\n- Add deterministic support in nn.functional.interpolate for XPU (#129864)  \r\n- Add batching rule for sdpa_math, sdpa_efficient_attention forward, cudnn, and flash attention (#133964)  \r\n- Support `nn.Module.mtia()` (#131499)\r\n\r\n### Optim\r\n\r\n- Move fused optimizers\u2019 param's device check to later in `_init_group` to allow better error checking in more cases (#131153)  \r\n- Update typing and 1-element check for tensor lr support on all optimizers (#131065)\r\n\r\n### Optimizer Frontend\r\n\r\n- Fix fake_tensor w/ non-view tensor (#132050)  \r\n- [BE][optim] Make pyright recognize exported symbols (#135043)\r\n\r\n### Profiler\r\n\r\n- [Memory Snapshot] Move user_defined annotations to Native Caching Allocator (#130964)  \r\n- [Memory Snapshot] Add recordAnnotations to capture record_function annotations (#129072)\r\n\r\n### Python Frontend\r\n\r\n- Improve error message for weights_only torch.load (#129705)  \r\n- Add new blocklist for weights_only load to prevent some modules from being allowlisted (#131259)  \r\n- Make PyTorch argparser understand python\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d type (#129580)  \r\n- Allow to register \u201cfallback\u201d to torch.library (#131707)  \r\n- Move module_tracker to general logging system when reporting confused hierarchy (#134467)  \r\n- Make `torch.serialization.set_default_mmap_options` usable as a context manager (#134371)\r\n\r\n### Quantization\r\n\r\n#### PT2E quantization\r\n\r\n- Support `set_module_name_qconfig` in X86InductorQuantizer (#126044)  \r\n- Enable PT2E symmetric dynamic quantization in metadata porting (#124615)  \r\n- Fix add annotation with constant (#132092)  \r\n- Fix Maxpool2d share quantization params (#132704)  \r\n- Fix getattr for quantizing constants (#132705)  \r\n- Use returned model from Quantizer.transform_for_annotation in prepare_pt2e (#132893)  \r\n\r\n#### Observers\r\n\r\n- Fix edge cases for HistogramObserver (#129387)  \r\n- Corner-case fix for upscale_histogram in the new HistogramObserver (#130316)\r\n\r\n#### Export IR Migration\r\n\r\n- Fix batch norm pattern match in quantization (#134157)  \r\n- Fix getitem not exist (#134259)  \r\n- Fix tests for quantized_decomposed.quantize_per_tensor decomposition (#134525)  \r\n\r\n#### Others\r\n\r\n- Enable torch.empty for float8 dtypes on cpu in deterministic mode (#128744)  \r\n- Fixing equalize with three things and improving functionality (#124632)  \r\n- Fix the warning for cat operators with same qparams (#133999)\r\n\r\n### Releng\r\n\r\n- Update NCCL to 2.21.5 (#124014)  \r\n- Update cuSPARSELt to v0.6.2 (#134022)  \r\n- Update CI/CD to CUDA 12.4.1 (#132202, #125944)  \r\n- [ROCm] upgrade CI/CD to 6.2, triton-rocm improvements.

(#129082)  \r\n- The issue Add lowering and codegen for aten.sort implements lowering and code generation for aten.sort in PyTorch's inductor, improving the performance of sorting operations by optimizing them for Triton kernels under specific size thresholds. (#128458)  \r\n- The issue Fallback to eager if re-record too many times ensures that if a CUDAGraph re-records a function too frequently (more than cudagraph_max_recording), PyTorch falls back to the eager execution mode, preventing performance degradation from excessive re-recording.(#129349)  \r\n- The issue Reinplacing should ignore copy_ nodes where the mutated argument is not read updates the reinplacing pass in the inductor backend to skip unnecessary clone() operations when the original tensor's value is not needed. This improves performance by avoiding redundant operations, particularly for custom operations and Triton kernels.  (#130866)  \r\n- The issue Avoid `OpOverloadPacket.__getattr__` calls in inductor lowering resolves inefficiencies caused by excessive calls to `__getattr__` during inductor lowering. By avoiding these calls, the patch prevents unnecessary exceptions that slow down compilation, improving overall performance. (#131348)  \r\n- The issue Always realize sigmoid for CPU modifies the inductor backend to ensure that sigmoid is realized in CPU operations, similar to how exp is handled. This update improves performance by preventing repeated computation of exp in nested loops during inference tasks, particularly for models like LLaMA2. (#128339)  \r\n- The issue bf16/fp16 gemm template computed with fp32 reintroduces the GEMM template for mixed-precision computation, allowing bf16 and fp16 values to be computed using fp32 precision in PyTorch's inductor backend. This enhances accuracy and stability for matrix multiplications involving lower precision data types.

As well, a new default TCPStore server backend utilizing `libuv` has been introduced\r\nwhich should significantly reduce initialization times for users running large-scale jobs.\r\nFinally, a new Python Custom Operator API makes it easier than before to integrate custom kernels\r\ninto PyTorch, especially for `torch.compile`.\r\n\r\nThis release is composed of 3661 commits and 475 contributors since PyTorch 2.3. We want to sincerely thank our \r\ndedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we \r\nimprove 2.4.

The issue will be fixed (#131194) in v2.4.1. It can be solved locally by setting the environment variable\r\n`TORCHINDUCTOR_WORKER_START=fork` before executing the script.\r\n\r\n### cu118 wheels will not work with pre-cuda12 drivers\r\n\r\nIt was also reported (#130684) that the new version of triton uses cuda features that are not compatible with pre-cuda12 drivers.\r\nIn this case, the [workaround](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/pull/4335#issuecomment-2232505298) is to set\r\n`TRITON_PTXAS_PATH` manually as follows (adapt the code according to the local installation path):\r\n```bash\r\nTRITON_PTXAS_PATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/bin/ptxas  python script.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backwards Incompatible Change\r\n\r\n### Python frontend\r\n\r\n#### Default `TreadPool` size to number of physical cores  (#125963)\r\n\r\nChanged the default number of threads used for intra-op parallelism from the number of logical cores to the number of\r\nphysical cores. This should reduce core oversubscribing when running CPU workload and improve performance.\r\nPrevious behavior can be recovered by using torch.set_num_threads to set the number of threads to the desired value.\r\n\r\n#### Fix `torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine.draw` default dtype handling (#126781)\r\n\r\nThe default dtype value has been changed from `torch.float32` to the current default dtype as given by\r\n`torch.get_default_dtype()` to be consistent with other APIs.\r\n\r\n#### Forbid subclassing `torch._C._TensorBase` directly (#125558)\r\n\r\nThis is an internal subclass that a user used to be able to create an object that is almost a Tensor in Python and was\r\nadvertised as such in some tutorials. This is not allowed anymore to improve consistency and all users should\r\nsubclass torch.Tensor directly.\r\n\r\n### Composability\r\n\r\n#### Non-compositional usages of as_strided + mutation under `torch.compile` will raise an error (#122502)\r\n\r\nThe `torch.compile` flow involves functionalizing any mutations inside the region being compiled. Torch.as_strided is\r\nan existing view op that can be used non-compositionally: meaning when you call x.as_strided(...), as_strided will only\r\nconsider the underlying storage size of x, and ignore its current size/stride/storage_offset when creating a new view.\r\nThis makes it difficult to safely functionalize mutations on views of as_strided that are created non-compositionally,\r\nso we ban them rather than risking silent correctness issues under torch.compile.\r\n\r\nAn example of a non-compositional usage of as_strided followed by mutation that we will error on is below. You can avoid\r\nthis issue by re-writing your usage of as_strided so that it is compositional (for example: either use a different set\r\nof view ops instead of as_strided, or call as_strided directly on the base tensor instead of an existing view of it).\r\n```python\r\n@torch.compile\r\ndef foo(a):\r\n    e = a.diagonal()\r\n    # as_strided is being called on an existing view (e),\r\n    # making it non-compositional. mutations to f under torch.compile\r\n    # are not allowed, as we cannot easily functionalize them safely\r\n    f = e.as_strided((2,), (1,), 0)\r\n    f.add_(1.0)\r\n    return a\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### We now verify schemas of custom ops at registration time (#124520)\r\n\r\nPreviously, you could register a custom op through the operator registration APIs, but give it a schema that contained\r\ntypes unknown to the PyTorch Dispatcher. This behavior came from TorchScript, where \u201cunknown\u201d types were implicitly\r\ntreated by the TorchScript interpreter as type variables. However, calling such a custom op through regular pytorch\r\nwould result in an error later. As of 2.4, we will raise an error at registration time, when you first register the\r\ncustom operator. You can get the old behavior by constructing the schema with allow_typevars=true.\r\n```\r\nTORCH_LIBRARY(my_ns, m) {\r\n  // this now raises an error at registration time: bar/baz are unknown types\r\n  m.def(\"my_ns::foo(bar t) -> baz\");\r\n  // you can get back the old behavior with the below flag\r\n  m.def(torch::schema(\"my_ns::foo(bar t) -> baz\", /*allow_typevars*/ true));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Autograd frontend\r\n\r\n#### Delete torch.autograd.function.traceable APIs (#122817)\r\n\r\nThe torch.autograd.function.traceable(...) API, which sets the is_traceable class attribute\r\non a torch.autograd.Function class was deprecated in 2.3 and is now being deleted.\r\nThis API does not do anything and was only meant for internal purposes.\r\nThe following raised an warning in 2.3, and now errors because the API has been deleted:\r\n```python\r\n@torch.autograd.function.traceable\r\nclass Func(torch.autograd.Function):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n### Release engineering\r\n\r\n- Remove caffe2 db and distributed from build system (#125092)\r\n\r\n### Optim\r\n\r\n- Remove `SparseAdam` weird allowance of raw Tensor input (#127081).\r\n\r\n### Distributed\r\n\r\n#### DeviceMesh\r\n\r\nUpdate get_group and add get_all_groups (#128097)\r\nIn 2.3 and before, users can do:\r\n```python\r\nmesh_2d = init_device_mesh(\r\n    \"cuda\", (2, 2), mesh_dim_names=(\"dp\", \"tp\")\r\n)\r\nmesh_2d.get_group()  # This will return all sub-pgs within the mesh\r\nassert mesh_2d.get_group()[0] == mesh_2d.get_group(0)\r\nassert mesh_2d.get_group()[1] == mesh_2d.get_group(1)\r\n```\r\nBut from 2.4 forward, if users call `get_group` without passing in the dim, users will get a `RuntimeError`.\r\nInstead, they should use `get_all_groups`:\r\n```python\r\nmesh_2d = init_device_mesh(\r\n    \"cuda\", (2, 2), mesh_dim_names=(\"dp\", \"tp\")\r\n)\r\nmesh_2d.get_group()  # This will throw a RuntimeError\r\nassert mesh_2d.get_all_groups()[0] == mesh_2d.get_group(0)\r\nassert mesh_2d.get_all_groups()[1] == mesh_2d.get_group(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Pipelining\r\n\r\nRetire torch.distributed.pipeline (#127354)\r\nIn 2.3 and before, users can do:\r\n```python\r\nimport torch.distributed.pipeline # warning saying that this will be removed and users need to migrate to torch.distributed.pipelining\r\n```\r\nBut from 2.4 forward, if users write the code above, users will get a `ModuleNotFound` error.\r\nInstead, they should use `torch.distributed.pipelining`:\r\n```python\r\nimport torch.distributed.pipeline # -> ModuleNotFoundError\r\nimport torch.distributed.pipelining\r\n```\r\n\r\n### jit\r\n\r\n- Fix serialization/deepcopy behavior for tensors that are aliasing but not equal (#126126)\r\n\r\n### Fx\r\n\r\nComplete revamp of float/promotion sympy handling (#126905)\r\n\r\n### ONNX\r\n\r\n- Remove caffe2 contrib and experiments (#125038)\r\n\r\n## Deprecations\r\n\r\n### Python frontend\r\n\r\n- User warning when using `torch.load` with default `weights_only=False` value (#129239, #129396, #129509).\r\n  A warning is now raised if the weights_only value is not specified during a call to torch.load, encouraging users to\r\n  adopt the safest practice when loading weights.\r\n- Deprecate device-specific autocast API (#126062)\r\n  All the autocast APIs are unified under torch.amp and it can be used as a drop-in replacement for torch.{device}.amp APIs\r\n  (passing a device argument where applicable)..\r\n- Export torch.newaxis=None for Python Array API/Numpy consistency (#125026)\r\n\r\n### Composability\r\n\r\n- Deprecate calling FakeTensor.data_ptr in eager-mode. FakeTensors are tensors without a valid data pointer, so in\r\n  general their data pointer is not safe to access. This makes it easier for `torch.compile` to provide a nice error\r\n  message when tracing custom ops into a graph that are not written in a PT2-friendly way (because, for example, they\r\n  try to directly access a tensor\u2019s data pointer from a region of code being traced).

To achieve the same functionality, users can manually\r\n  filter out the `state_dict` returned from `get_state_dict` API and preprocess the model_state_dict before\r\n  calling `set_state_dict` API:\r\n  ```python\r\n  model = AnyModel(device=torch.device(\"cuda\"))\r\n  model_state_dict = get_model_state_dict(model)\r\n  set_model_state_dict(\r\n      model,\r\n      model_state_dict=new_model_state_dict,\r\n      options=StateDictOptions(strict=False),\r\n  )\r\n  # Deprecating warnings thrown for the below way of calling API\r\n  model_state_dict2 = get_model_state_dict(model, submodules={model.submodule})\r\n  set_model_state_dict(\r\n      model,\r\n      model_state_dict={model.submodule: new_submodel_state_dict},\r\n      options=StateDictOptions(strict=False),\r\n  )\r\n  ```\r\n- FullyShardedDataParallel (FSDP)\r\n  Deprecate FSDP.state_dict_type and redirect users to distributed_state_dict (#127794)\r\n  In 2.3 and before, users can do:\r\n  ```python\r\n  model = AnyModel(device=torch.device(\"cuda\"))\r\n  fsdp_model = FSDP(model)\r\n  # Users can do both ways below\r\n  get_model_state_dict(model)\r\n  with FSDP.state_dict_type(fsdp_model, StateDictType.FULL_STATE_DICT):\r\n      fsdp_model.state_dict()\r\n  ```\r\n  But from 2.4 forward, if users call `state_dict` or set `state_dict` with the FSDP.state_dict_type, users will see warnings. And the recommended solution now is to use `get_model_state_dict` and `set_model_state_dict` directly:\r\n  ```python\r\n  model = AnyModel(device=torch.device(\"cuda\"))\r\n  fsdp_model = FSDP(model)\r\n\r\n  get_model_state_dict(model)\r\n  # Deprecating warnings thrown for the below way of calling API\r\n  with FSDP.state_dict_type(fsdp_model, StateDictType.FULL_STATE_DICT):\r\n      fsdp_model.state_dict()\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Profiler\r\n\r\n- Remove FlameGraph usage steps from export_stacks docstring (#123102)\r\n  The export_stacks API will continue to work as before, however we\u2019ve removed the docstring to use FrameGraph.\r\n  PyTorch doesn\u2019t own FrameGraph, and cannot guarantee that it functions properly.\r\n\r\n### Quantization\r\n\r\n- Remove deprecated `torch._aminmax` operator (#125995).\r\n  `torch._aminmax` -> `torch.aminmax` instead\r\n\r\n### Export\r\n\r\n- Start deprecation of capture_pre_autograd_graph (#125848, #126403)\r\n\r\n### XPU\r\n\r\n- Refactor autocast C++ APIs to be device-agnostic(#124359)\r\n  `at::autocast::get_autocast_gpu_dtype()` -> `at::autocast::get_autocast_dtype(at::kCUDA)`\r\n  `at::autocast::get_autocast_cpu_dtype()` -> `at::autocast::get_autocast_dtype(at::kCPU)`\r\n- Refactor autocast Python APIs(#124479)\r\n  `torch.get_autocast_gpu_dtype()` -> `torch.get_autocast_dtype(\u201ccuda\u201d)`,\r\n  `torch.set_autocast_gpu_dtype(dtype)` -> `torch.set_autocast_dtype(\u201ccuda\u201d, dtype)`,\r\n  `torch.is_autocast_enabled() ` -> `torch.is_autocast_enabled(\u201ccuda\u201d)`,\r\n  `torch.set_autocast_enabled(enabled)` -> `torch.set_autocast_enabled(\u201dcuda\u201d, enabled)`,\r\n  `torch.get_autocast_cpu_dtype()` -> `torch.get_autocast_dtype(\u201ccpu\u201d)`\r\n- Make torch.amp.autocast more generic (#125103)\r\n  `torch.cuda.amp.autocast(args\u2026) ` -> `torch.amp.autocast(\u201ccuda\u201d,args\u2026)`,\r\n  `torch.cpu.amp.autocast(args\u2026) ` -> `torch.amp.autocast(\u201ccpu\u201d, args\u2026)`,\r\n- Deprecate device-specific GradScaler autocast API(#126527)\r\n  `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(args\u2026) ` -> `torch.amp.GradScaler(\u201ccuda\u201d, args\u2026)`,\r\n  `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(args\u2026) ` -> `torch.amp.GradScaler(\u201ccpu\u201d, args\u2026)`,\r\n- Generalize custom_fwd&custom_bwd to be device-agnostic (#126531)\r\n  `torch.cuda.amp.custom_fwd(args\u2026) ` -> `torch.amp.custom_fwd(args\u2026, device_type=\u2019cuda\u2019)`,\r\n### ONNX\r\n\r\n- Remove more caffe2 files (#126628)\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n### Python frontend\r\n\r\n- Add\r\n  - support for unsigned int sizes for torch.unique (#123643)\r\n  - torch.OutOfMemoryError to signify out of memory error from any device (#121702)\r\n  - new device-agnostic API for autocast in torch.amp.* (#124938)\r\n  - new device-agnostic API for Stream/Event in torch.{Stream,Event} (#125757)\r\n  - channels last support to max, average and adaptive pooling functions (#116305)\r\n  - torch.serialization.add_safe_globals that allows users to allowlist classes for weights_only\r\n    load (#124331, #124330, #127808)\r\n  - pickling support for torch.Generator (#126271)\r\n  - torch.utils.module_tracker to track position within torch.nn.Module hierarchy (#125352)\r\n\r\n### Composability\r\n\r\n- Add\r\n  - OpOverload.redispatch;

This was a frequently raised\r\n  issue in the past (examples (#111785, #120248, #120958, #117758, #124357, #124717, #124817)).\r\n  This increases TorchDynamo soundness with minimal perf impact.\r\n- Hardened the recently introduced tracing rules infrastructure. This allows `torch.compile` users to easily control TorchDynamo tracing of PyTorch internal code.\r\n- Extended `torch.compile` support for RAdam and Adamax optimizer. Compiler optimizers now demonstrate SOTA performance.\r\n- Experimental feature - We introduced a new experimental flag torch._dynamo.config.inline_inbuilt_nn_modules to enable `torch.compile` to reuse compiled\r\n  artifacts on repeated blocks in the models. This gives another point in the tradeoff space of compilation time and performance speedup.\r\n  By moving `torch.compile` from full model to a repeated block (e.g. moving `torch.compile` from full LLM to a repeated Transformer block),\r\n  we can now achieve faster compilation time with some performance dip compared to full model.\r\n  We plan to make this flag default to True in the 2.5 release.\r\n\r\n### Export\r\n\r\n- Introduce ShapesCollection, a dynamic shapes builder API (#124898)\r\n\r\n### Inductor\r\n\r\n- Add higher order associative scan operator (#119430)\r\n\r\n### jit\r\n\r\n- Add aten::sort.any op for sorting lists of arbitrary elements (#123982)\r\n\r\n### MPS\r\n\r\n- Conform torch.mps to device module interface (#124676)\r\n\r\n### XPU\r\n\r\n- Inductor Intel GPU backend (#121895)\r\n- a new autocast API torch.amp.is_autocast_available(#124938)\r\n- attributes to xpu device prop (#121898)\r\n- XPU implementation for PyTorch ATen operators (#120891)\r\n- generic stream/event on XPU backend (#125751)\r\n- gpu trace on XPU (#121795)\r\n- Switch to torch.float16 on XPU AMP mode (#127741)\r\n\r\n### ONNX\r\n\r\n- quantized layer norm op to opset 17 (#127640)\r\n- symbolic_opset19.py and symbolic_opset20.py to support opset 19/20, extend opset 18 support (#118828)\r\n- Support for Some Bitwise Ops in Onnx Exporter (#126229)\r\n- Allow ONNX models without parameters (#121904)\r\n- Integrate onnxscript optimizer (#123379)\r\n\r\n### Vulkan\r\n\r\n- quantized transposed 2D convolutions (#120151, #122547)\r\n- the quantized ReLU operator (#123004)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n### Python frontend\r\n\r\n- bfloat16 support for torch.binary_cross_entropy on CPU (#123823)\r\n- MAP_SHARED option for torch.load when mmap=True (#124889)\r\n- default value when printing function signature (#127059)\r\n- all variants of upsampling functions to be done in high precision in autocast (#121324)\r\n\r\n### Composability\r\n\r\n- FakeTensors, meta tensors and python decompositions are used to perform shape propagation when tracing out a graph in\r\n  torch.compile.

PyTorch 2.3 offers support for user-defined Triton kernels in torch.compile, allowing for users to migrate their own Triton kernels from eager without experiencing performance complications or graph breaks. As well, Tensor Parallelism improves the experience for training Large Language Models using native PyTorch functions, which has been validated on training runs for 100B parameter models.\r\n\r\nThis release is composed of 3393 commits and 426 contributors since PyTorch 2.2. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.3. More information about how to get started with the PyTorch 2-series can be found at our [Getting Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/) page.\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>Stable</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>Beta</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>Prototype</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>Performance Improvements</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>User-defined Triton kernels in torch.compile\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.export adds new API to specify dynamic_shapes\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Weight-Only-Quantization introduced into Inductor CPU backend\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Tensor parallelism within PyTorch Distributed\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Asynchronous checkpoint generation\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Support for semi-structured sparsity\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n*To see a full list of public feature submissions click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TzGkWuUMF1yTe88adz1dt2mzbIsZLd3PBasy588VWgk/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tracked Regressions\r\n\r\n\r\n### **torch.compile on MacOS is considered unstable for 2.3 as there are known cases where it will hang ([#124497](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/124497))**\r\n\r\n\r\n### **torch.compile imports many unrelated packages when it is invoked ([#123954](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/123954))**\r\n\r\nThis can cause significant first-time slowdown and instability when these packages are not fully compatible with PyTorch within a single process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **torch.compile is not supported on Python 3.12 ([#120233](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/120233))**\r\n\r\nPyTorch support for Python 3.12 in general is considered experimental. Please use Python version between 3.8 and 3.11 instead. This is an existing issue since PyTorch 2.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Change default torch_function behavior to be disabled when torch_dispatch is defined (#120632)**\r\n\r\nDefining a subclass with a **torch_dispatch** entry will now automatically set **torch_function** to be disabled. This aligns better with all the use cases we\u2019ve observed for subclasses. The main change of behavior is that the result of the torch_dispatch handler will not go through the default torch_function handler anymore, wrapping it into the current subclass. This allows in particular for your subclass to return a plain Tensor or another subclass from any op.\r\n\r\nThe original behavior can be recovered by adding the following to your Tensor subclass:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@classmethod\r\ndef __torch_function__(cls, func, types, args=(), kwargs=None):\r\n      return super().__torch_function__(func, types, args, kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **ProcessGroupNCCL removes multi-device-per-thread support from C++ level (#119099, #118674)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Python level support was removed in 2.2.\r\n* To simplify ProcessGroupNCCL\u2019s code, we remove support for multiple cuda devices per thread.  To our knowledge, this is not an active use case, but it adds a large burden to our codebase. If you are relying on this, there is no workaround other than rewriting your pytorch program to use one device per process or one device per thread (multi-threads per process is still supported).\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Removes `no_dist` and `coordinator_rank` from public DCP API's (#121317)**\r\n\r\nAs part of an overall effort to simplify our public facing API's for Distributed Checkpointing, we've decided to deprecate usage of the `coordinator_rank` and `no_dist` parameters under `torch.distributed.checkpoint`. In our opinion, these parameters can lead to confusion around the intended effect during API usage, and have limited value to begin with. One concrete example is here, https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/118337, where there is ambiguity in which Process Group is referenced by the coordinator rank (additional context: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/118337). In the case of the `no_dist` parameter, we consider this an implementation detail which should be hidden from the user. Starting in this release, `no_dist` is inferred from the initialized state of the process group, assuming the intention is to use collectives if a process group is initialized, and assuming the opposite in the case it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>2.2</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>2.3</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Version 2.2.2\r\nimport torch.distributed.checkpoint as dcp\r\n\r\ndcp.save(\r\n\tstate_dict={\"model\": model.state_dict()},\r\n       checkpoint_id=\"path_to_model_checkpoint\"\r\n       no_dist=True,\r\n       coordinator_rank=0\r\n)\r\n# ...\r\ndcp.load(\r\n\tstate_dict={\"model\": model.state_dict()},\r\n       checkpoint_id=\"path_to_model_checkpoint\"\r\n       no_dist=True,\r\n       coordinator_rank=0\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Version 2.2.3\r\n# no dist is assumed from pg state, and rank 0 is always coordinator.\r\nimport torch.distributed.checkpoint as dcp\r\n\r\ndcp.save(\r\n\tstate_dict={\"model\": model.state_dict()},\r\n       checkpoint_id=\"path_to_model_checkpoint\"\r\n) \r\n# ...\r\ndcp.load(\r\n\tstate_dict={\"model\": model.state_dict()},\r\n       checkpoint_id=\"path_to_model_checkpoint\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Remove deprecated tp_mesh_dim arg (#121432)**\r\n\r\nStarting from PyTorch 2.3, `parallelize_module` API only accepts a DeviceMesh (the `tp_mesh_dim` argument has been removed). If having a N-D DeviceMesh for multi-dimensional parallelism, you can use `mesh_nd[\"tp\"]` to obtain a 1-D DeviceMesh for tensor parallelism.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **torch.export**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Users must pass in an nn.Module to torch.export.export. The reason is that we have several invariants the ExportedProgram that are ambiguous if the top-level object being traced is a function, such as how we guarantee that every call_function node has an nn_module_stack populated, and we offer ways to access the state_dict/parameters/buffers of the exported program. We'd like torch.export to offer strong invariants\u2014the value proposition of export is that you can trade flexibility for stronger guarantees about your model. (#117528)\r\n* Removed constraints in favor of dynamic_shapes (#117573, #117917, #117916, #120981, #120979)\r\n* ExportedProgram is no longer a callable. Instead users will need to use .module() to call the ExportedProgram. This is to prevent users from treating ExportedPrograms as torch.nn.Modules as we do not plan to support all features that torch.nn.Modules have, like hooks. Instead users can create a proper torch.nn.Module through exported_program.module() and use that as a callable. (#120019, #118425, #119105)\r\n* Remove equality_constraints from ExportedProgram as it is not used or useful anymore. Dimensions with equal constraints will now have the same symbol. (#116979)\r\n* Remove torch._export.export in favor of torch.export.export (#119095)\r\n* Remove CallSpec (#117671)\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Enable fold_quantize by default in PT2 Export Quantization (#118701, #118605, #119425, #117797)**\r\n\r\nPreviously, the PT2 Export Quantization flow did not generate quantized weight by default, but instead used fp32 weight in the quantized model in this pattern: `fp32 weight -> q -> dq -> linear`. Setting `fold_quantize=True` produces a graph with quantized weights in the quantized model in this pattern by default after convert_pt2e, and users will see a reduction in the model size: `int8 weight -> dq -> linear`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>2.2</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>2.3</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfolded_model = convert_pt2e(model, fold_quantize=True)\r\nnon_folded_model = convert_pt2e(model)\r\n```\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfolded_model = convert_pt2e(model)\r\nnon_folded_model = convert_pt2e(model, fold_quantize=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Remove deprecated torch.jit.quantized APIs (#118406)**\r\n\r\nAll functions and classes under `torch.jit.quantized` will now raise an error if called/instantiated. This API has long been deprecated in favor of `torch.ao.nn.quantized`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>2.2</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>2.3</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# torch.jit.quantized APIs\r\n\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.quantize_rnn_cell_modules\r\n\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.quantize_rnn_modules\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.quantize_linear_modules\r\n\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.QuantizedLinear\r\ntorch.jit.QuantizedLinearFP16\r\n\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.QuantizedGRU\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.QuantizedGRUCell\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.QuantizedLSTM\r\ntorch.jit.quantized.QuantizedLSTMCell\r\n```\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Corresponding torch.ao.quantization APIs\r\n\r\ntorch.ao.nn.quantized.dynamic.RNNCell\r\n\r\ntorch.ao.quantization.quantize_dynamic APIs\r\n\r\ntorch.ao.nn.quantized.dynamic.Linear\r\n\r\ntorch.ao.nn.quantized.dynamic.GRU\r\ntorch.ao.nn.quantized.dynamic.GRUCell\r\ntorch.ao.nn.quantized.dynamic.LSTM\r\n```\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Remove deprecated fbgemm operators (#112153)**\r\n\r\n`TorchScript` models that were exported with the deprecated `torch.jit.quantized` API will no longer be loadable, as the required internal operators have been removed. Please re-export your models using the newer `torch.ao.quantization` API instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **Other**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Make `List::get() const` match `List::operator[]() const` (#117568)\r\n* Delete `C10_IS_TRIVIALLY_COPYABLE` (#120120)\r\n* Fix synchronization behavior for copies with type change (#121341)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n\r\n### **torch.autograd.Function: Using the torch.autograd.function.traceable decorator and getting/setting torch.autograd.Function's is_traceable is now deprecated (#121413)**\r\n\r\nThese decorators were previously marked for internal use only. They will be removed in version 2.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **torch.utils.checkpoint: not passing use_reentrant explicitly to activation checkpoint and checkpoint_sequential is deprecated (#116710)**\r\n\r\ntorch.utils.checkpoint: the use_reentrant parameter should be passed explicitly. In version 2.4 we will raise an exception if use_reentrant is not passed. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.\r\n\r\n(Note that this was already deprecated in a previous release. In this version, we improve the deprecation message.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Deprecated <code>torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel</code> and replace with <code>torch.nn.attention.sdpa_kernel</code> (#114689)**\r\n\r\nThis PR deprecated `torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel`, users can now use `torch.nn.attention.sdpa_kernel` instead. The old code will raise the following warning: `FutureWarning: torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel() is deprecated. In the future, this context manager will be removed.

trackers are now mutable. Therefore, we can just mutate the variable tracker during symbolic tracing, instead of creating a new variable tracker. This improves compilation time for models with frequent mutations.\r\n* (beta feature) Improved automatic deletion of compilation units - TorchDynamo caches the compilation units internally on every compilation event. Earlier, this cache was not cleared automatically when the original nn module went out of scope, holding on to the GPU memory. Therefore, users needed to call `torch._dynamo.reset()` to clear the cache. Now, we automatically clear the cache as soon as the nn module goes out of scope.\r\n* (beta feature) torch.compile works with User defined triton kernels  - Allows for PyTorch code that contains a triton kernel to be executed natively using torch.compile. This will allow users to migrate code containing triton kernels from eager PyTorch to using torch.compile without running into performance complications or graph breaks.

PyTorch 2.2 offers ~2x performance improvements to `scaled_dot_product_attention` via FlashAttention-v2 integration, as well as AOTInductor, a new ahead-of-time compilation and deployment tool built for  non-python server-side deployments.\r\n\r\nThis release also includes improved torch.compile support for Optimizers, a number of new inductor optimizations, and a new logging mechanism called TORCH_LOGS.\r\n\r\n**Please note that we are [deprecating macOS x86 support](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/114602), and PyTorch 2.2.x will be the last version that supports macOS x64.**\r\n\r\nAlong with 2.2, we are also releasing a series of updates to the PyTorch domain libraries. More details can be found in the library updates blog.\r\n\r\nThis release is composed of 3,628 commits and 521 contributors since PyTorch 2.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.2.  More information about how to get started with the PyTorch 2-series can be found at our [Getting Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/) page.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- `scaled_dot_product_attention` (SDPA) now supports FlashAttention-2, yielding around 2x speedups compared to previous versions.\r\n- PyTorch 2.2 introduces a new ahead-of-time extension of TorchInductor called AOTInductor, designed to compile and deploy PyTorch programs for non-python server-side.\r\n- `torch.distributed` supports a new abstraction for initializing and representing ProcessGroups called device_mesh.\r\n- PyTorch 2.2 ships a standardized, configurable logging mechanism called TORCH_LOGS.\r\n- A number of torch.compile improvements are included in PyTorch 2.2, including improved support for compiling Optimizers and improved TorchInductor fusion and layout optimizations.\r\n- Please note that we are deprecating macOS x86 support, and PyTorch 2.2.x will be the last version that supports macOS x64.\r\n- `torch.ao.quantization` now offers a prototype `torch.export` based flow\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>Stable</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td><strong>Beta</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td><strong>Prototype</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td><strong>Performance Improvements</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>FlashAttentionV2 backend for scaled dot product attention\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>PT 2 Quantization\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Inductor optimizations\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> AOTInductor\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> Scaled dot product attention support for jagged layout NestedTensors\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>aarch64-linux optimizations (AWS Graviton)\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> TORCH_LOGS\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.distributed.device_mesh\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.compile + Optimizers\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\\*To see a full list of public 2.2 - 1.12 feature submissions click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TzGkWuUMF1yTe88adz1dt2mzbIsZLd3PBasy588VWgk/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n# Tracked Regressions\r\n\r\n### **Performance reduction when using NVLSTree algorithm in NCCL 2.19.3 (#117748)**\r\n\r\nWe have noticed a performance regression introduced to all-reduce in NCCL 2.19.3.

And we have default values for _prepare_input and _prepare_output. The UX of Tensor Parallel was like:\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch.distributed.tensor.parallel.style import (\r\n    ColwiseParallel,\r\n    make_input_replicate_1d,\r\n    make_input_reshard_replicate,\r\n    make_input_shard_1d,\r\n    make_input_shard_1d_last_dim,\r\n    make_sharded_output_tensor,\r\n    make_output_replicate_1d,\r\n    make_output_reshard_tensor,\r\n    make_output_shard_1d,\r\n    make_output_tensor,\r\n    PairwiseParallel,\r\n    parallelize_module,\r\n)\r\nfrom torch.distributed.tensor import DeviceMesh\r\n\r\nmodule = DummyModule()\r\ndevice_mesh = DeviceMesh(\"cuda\", list(range(self.world_size)))\r\nparallelize_module(module, device_mesh, PairwiseParallel(_prepare_input=make_input_replicate_1d))\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarting from PyTorch 2.2, we simplified parallel styles to only contain `ColwiseParallel` and `RowwiseParallel` because other ParallelStyle can consist of these two. We also deleted the input/output functions, and started using `input_layouts` and `output_layouts` as kwargs instead to specify the sharding layout of both input/output tensors. Finally, added PrepareModuleInput/PrepareModuleOutput style, and no default arguments for layouts in these two styles and users need to specify them to think about the sharding layouts.\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch.distributed.tensor.parallel.style import (\r\n    ColwiseParallel,\r\n    PrepareModuleInput,\r\n    RowwiseParallel,\r\n    parallelize_module,\r\n)\r\nfrom torch.distributed._tensor import init_device_mesh\r\n\r\nmodule = SimpleMLPModule()\r\ndevice_mesh = init_device_mesh(\"cuda\", (self.world_size,)))\r\nparallelize_module(\r\n   module,\r\n   device_mesh,\r\n   {\r\n      \"fqn\": PrepareModuleInput(\r\n                input_layouts=Shard(0),\r\n                desired_input_layouts=Replicate()\r\n             ),\r\n      \"fqn.net1\": ColwiseParallel(),\r\n      \"fqn.net2\": RowwiseParallel(output_layouts=Shard(0)),\r\n   }\r\n)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### **`UntypedStorage.resize_` now uses the original device instead of the current device context (#113386)**\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `UntypedStorage.resize_` would move data to the current CUDA device index (given by `torch.cuda.current_device()`).\r\nNow, `UntypedStorage.resize_()` keeps the data on the same device index that it was on before, regardless of the current device index.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>2.1</th>\r\n<th>2.2</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> with torch.cuda.device('cuda:0'):\r\n...:     a = torch.zeros(0, device='cuda:1')\r\n...:     print(a.device)\r\n...:     a = a.untyped_storage().resize_(0)\r\n...:     print(a.device)\r\ncuda:1\r\ncuda:0\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> with torch.cuda.device('cuda:0'):\r\n...:     a = torch.zeros(0, device='cuda:1')\r\n...:     print(a.device)\r\n...:     a = a.untyped_storage().resize_(0)\r\n...:     print(a.device)\r\ncuda:1\r\ncuda:1\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Wrapping a function with set_grad_enabled will consume its global mutation (#113359)**\r\nThis bc-breaking change fixes some unexpected behavior when `set_grad_enabled` is used as a decorator.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>2.1</th>\r\n<th>2.2</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> @torch.set_grad_enabled(False)  # unexpectedly, this mutates the grad mode!\r\n    def inner_func(x):\r\n        return x.sin()\r\n\r\n>>> torch.is_grad_enabled()\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> @torch.set_grad_enabled(False)  # unexpectedly, this mutates the grad mode!\r\n    def inner_func(x):\r\n        return x.sin()\r\n\r\n>>> torch.is_grad_enabled()\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### **Deprecated `verbose` parameter in `LRscheduler` constructors (#111302)**\r\nAs part of our decision to move towards a consolidated logging system, we are deprecating the `verbose` flag in `LRScheduler`.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to print the learning rate during execution, please use `get_last_lr()`\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>2.1</th>\r\n<th>2.2</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)\r\nscheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min', verbose=True)\r\nfor epoch in range(10):\r\n    train(...)\r\n    val_loss = validate(...)\r\n    # Note that step should be called after validate()\r\n    scheduler.step(val_loss)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)\r\nscheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min')\r\nfor epoch in range(10):\r\n    train(...)\r\n    val_loss = validate(...)\r\n    # Note that step should be called after validate()\r\n    scheduler.step(val_loss)\r\n\tprint(f\"Epoch {epoch} has concluded with lr of {scheduler.get_last_lr()}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### **Removed deprecated c10d multi-gpu-per-thread APIs (#114156)**\r\nIn PyTorch 2.1 or before, users can use our multi-gpu c10d collective APIs such as `all_reduce_multigpu`:\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>2.1</th>\r\n<th>2.2</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nimport torch.distributed as dist\r\n\r\n\r\ndist.broadcast_multigpu\r\ndist.all_reduce_multigpu\r\ndist.reduce_multigpu\r\ndist.all_gather_multigpu\r\ndist.reduce_scatter_multigpu\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\noptimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)\r\nscheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min')\r\nfor epoch in range(10):\r\n    train(...)\r\n    val_loss = validate(...)\r\n    # Note that step should be called after validate()\r\n    scheduler.step(val_loss)\r\n\tprint(f\"Epoch {epoch} has concluded with lr of {scheduler.get_last_lr()}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nIn PyTorch 2.2, these APIs are removed because PyTorch Distributed's preferred programming model is one device per thread, as exemplified by the APIs in its document.

There were a number of op coverage improvements this release:\r\n  - `masked_scatter` (#108802), `_segment_reduce` (#109359), `foreach` ops (#112281), `linear_backward` (#114359), `scaled_mm` (#112609)\r\n- We have python \u201creference\u201d decompositions for many aten operators. These are used during the tracing step of torch.compile. In a few ways: sometimes they are used to directly decompose operators in the captured graph. Other times, they are used as an alternative to a shape-propagation rule for an operator.

PyTorch 2.1 offers automatic dynamic shape support in torch.compile, torch.distributed.checkpoint for saving/loading distributed training jobs on multiple ranks in parallel, and torch.compile support for the NumPy API.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this release offers numerous performance improvements (e.g. CPU inductor improvements, AVX512 support, scaled-dot-product-attention support) as well as a prototype release of torch.export, a sound full-graph capture mechanism, and `torch.export`-based quantization.\r\n\r\nAlong with 2.1, we are also releasing a series of updates to the PyTorch domain libraries. More details can be found in the library updates blog. \r\n\r\nThis release is composed of 6,682 commits and 784 contributors since 2.0. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.1.  More information about how to get started with the PyTorch 2-series can be found at our [Getting Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/) page.\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n- `torch.compile` now includes automatic support for detecting and minimizing recompilations due to tensor shape changes using automatic dynamic shapes.\r\n- `torch.distributed.checkpoint` enables saving and loading models from multiple ranks in parallel, as well as resharding due to changes in cluster topology.\r\n- `torch.compile` can now compile NumPy operations via translating them into PyTorch-equivalent operations.\r\n- `torch.compile` now includes improved support for Python 3.11.\r\n- New CPU performance features include inductor improvements (e.g. bfloat16 support and dynamic shapes), AVX512 kernel support, and scaled-dot-product-attention kernels.\r\n- `torch.export`, a sound full-graph capture mechanism is introduced as a prototype feature, as well as torch.export-based quantization.\r\n- `torch.sparse` now includes prototype support for semi-structured (2:4) sparsity on NVIDIA\u00ae GPUs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n<td> <strong> Stable </strong>\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> <strong> Beta </strong>\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> <strong>Prototype </strong>\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> <strong>Performance Improvements </strong>\r\n\r\n  </tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> \r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Automatic Dynamic Shapes\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td> torch.export()\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>AVX512 kernel support\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.distributed.checkpoint\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.export-based Quantization\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>CPU optimizations for scaled-dot-product-attention (SDPA)\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.compile + NumPy\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>semi-structured (2:4) sparsity\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>CPU optimizations for bfloat16\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.compile + Python 3.11\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>cpp_wrapper for torchinductor\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.compile + autograd.Function\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>third-party device integration: PrivateUse1\r\n\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n*To see a full list of public 2.1, 2.0, and 1.13 feature submissions click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TzGkWuUMF1yTe88adz1dt2mzbIsZLd3PBasy588VWgk/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\nFor more details about these highlighted features, you can look at the release blogpost.\r\nBelow are the full release notes for this release.\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n### Building PyTorch from source now requires C++ 17 (#100557)\r\nThe PyTorch codebase has migrated from the C++14 to the C++17 standard, so a C++17 compatible compiler is now required to compile PyTorch, to integrate with libtorch, or to implement a C++ PyTorch extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Disable `torch.autograd.{backward, grad}` for complex scalar output (#92753)\r\n\r\nGradients are not defined for functions that don't return real outputs; we now raise an error if you try to call backward on complex outputs. Previously, the complex component of the output was implicitly ignored. If you wish to preserve this behavior, you must now explicitly call `.real` on your complex outputs before calling `.grad()` or `.backward()`.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n```python\r\ndef fn(x):\r\n    return (x * 0.5j).sum()\r\n\r\nx = torch.ones(1, dtype=torch.double, requires_grad=True)\r\no = fn(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2.0.1\r\n```python\r\no.backward()\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2.1\r\n```python\r\no.real.backward()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update non-reentrant checkpoint to allow nesting and support `autograd.grad` (#90105)\r\n\r\nAs a part of a larger refactor to `torch.utils.checkpoint`, we changed the interaction activation checkpoint and `retain_graph=True`. Previously in 2.0.1, recomputed activations are kept alive if `retain_graph=True`, in PyTorch 2.1, non-reentrant impl now clears recomputed tensors on backward immediately upon unpack, even if `retain_graph=True`. This has the following additional implications: (1) Accessing `ctx.saved_tensor` twice in the same backward will now raise an error.  (2) Accessing `_saved_tensors` multiple times will silently recompute forward multiple times.  \r\n\r\n#### 2.1\r\n```python\r\nclass Func(torch.autograd.Function):\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def forward(ctx, x):\r\n        out = x.exp()\r\n        ctx.save_for_backward(out)\r\n        return out\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def backward(ctx, x);\r\n        out, = ctx.saved_tensors\r\n        # Calling ctx.saved_tensors again will raise in 2.1\r\n        out, = ctx.saved_tensors\r\n        return out\r\n\r\na = torch.tensor(1., requires_grad=True)\r\n\r\ndef fn(x):\r\n    return Func.apply(x)\r\n\r\n\r\nout = torch.utils.checkpoint(fn, (a,), use_reentrant=False)\r\n\r\ndef fn2(x):\r\n    return x.exp()\r\n\r\nout = torch.utils.checkpoint(fn2, (a,), use_reentrant=False)\r\n\r\nout.grad_fn._saved_result\r\n# Calling _saved_result will trigger another unpack, and lead to forward being\r\n# recomputed again\r\nout.grad_fn._saved_result\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Only sync buffers when `broadcast_buffers` is True (#100729)\r\n* In PyTorch 2.0.1 and previous releases, when users use DistributedDataParallel (DDP), all buffers were synced automatically even if users set flag `broadcast_buffers` to be `False`:\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\r\nmodule = torch.nn.Linear(4, 8)\r\nmodule = DDP(module) # Buffer is synchronized across all devices.\r\nmodule = DDP(module, broadcast_buffers=False) # Buffer is synchronized across all devices.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Starting with PyTorch 2.1, if users specify the flag `broadcast_buffers` to be `False`, we don\u2019t sync the buffer across devices:\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP\r\nmodule = torch.nn.Linear(4, 8)\r\nmodule = DDP(module) # Buffer is synchronized across all devices.\r\nmodule = DDP(module, broadcast_buffers=False) # Buffer is NOT synchronized across all devices\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remove store barrier after PG init (#99937)\r\n* In PyTorch 2.0.1 and previous releases, after we initialize PG, we always call store based barrier:\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch.distributed.distributed_c10d import init_process_group\r\ninit_process_group(...) # Will call _store_based_barrier in the end.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Starting with PyTorch 2.1, after we initialize PG, the environment variable `TORCH_DIST_INIT_BARRIER` controls whether we call store based barrier or not:\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch.distributed.distributed_c10d import init_process_group\r\nimport os\r\nos.environ[\"TORCH_DIST_INIT_BARRIER\"] = \"1\" # This is the default behavior\r\ninit_process_group(...) # Will call _store_based_barrier in the end.\r\nos.environ[\"TORCH_DIST_INIT_BARRIER\"] = \"0\"\r\ninit_process_group(...) # Will not call _store_based_barrier in the end.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Disallow non-bool masks in `torch.masked_{select, scatter, fill}` (#96112, #97999, #96594)\r\nFinish the deprecation cycle for non-bool masks. Functions now require the `dtype` of the mask to be `torch.bool`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> # 2.0.1\r\n>>> inp = torch.rand(3)\r\n>>> mask = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0], dtype=torch.uint8)\r\n>>> torch.masked_select(inp, mask)\r\nUserWarning: masked_select received a mask with dtype torch.uint8, this behavior is now deprecated,please use a mask with dtype torch.bool instead. (Triggered internally at ../aten/src/ATen/native/TensorAdvancedIndexing.cpp:1855.)\r\n  torch.masked_select(inp, mask)\r\n\r\n>>> torch.masked_select(inp, mask.to(dtype=torch.bool))\r\n# Works fine\r\n\r\n>>> correct_mask = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0], dtype=torch.bool)\r\n>>> torch.masked_select(inp, correct_mask)\r\n# Works fine\r\n\r\n>>> # 2.1\r\n>>> inp = torch.rand(3)\r\n>>> mask = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0], dtype=torch.uint8)\r\n>>> torch.masked_select(inp, mask)\r\nRuntimeError: masked_select: expected BoolTensor for mask\r\n\r\n>>> correct_mask = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0], dtype=torch.bool)\r\n>>> torch.masked_select(inp, correct_mask)\r\n# Works fine\r\n\r\n>>> torch.masked_select(inp, mask.to(dtype=torch.bool))\r\n# Works fine\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fix the result of `torch.unique` to make it consistent with NumPy when `dim` is specified (#101693)\r\n\r\nThe `dim` argument was clarified and its behavior aligned to match the one from NumPy to signify which sub-tensor to consider when considering uniqueness. See the documentation for more details, https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.unique.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Make the Index Rounding Mode Consistent Between the 2D and 3D GridSample Nearest Neighbor Interpolations (#97000)\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, for `torch.nn.functional.grid_sample(mode='nearest')` the forward 2D kernel used `std::nearbyint` whereas the forward 3D kernel used `std::round` in order to determine the nearest pixel locations after un-normalization of the grid. Additionally, the backward kernels for both used `std::round`. This PR fixes the inconsistencies to use `std::nearbyint` which rounds values that are exactly <>.5 to the nearest even which is consistent with the behavior of `torch.round`. Unnormalized indices that are exactly <>.5 will now be rounded to the nearest even instead of being rounded away from 0.\r\n\r\n### Turned input shapes (aka `record_shapes`) off by default for on-demand tracing (#97917)\r\nProfiler traces collected by on-demand tracing via IPC Fabric will have `record_shapes` off my default. \r\n\r\n* In v2.0.1:\r\nBy default, profiler trace files\u2019 `cpu_op` activities will contain metadata fields: Input Dims, and Input type.\r\n\r\n* In v2.1.0:\r\nBy default, profiler trace files\u2019 `cpu_op` activities will no longer contain metadata fields for input shapes. If turned on via Kineto config, it will show metadata fields: Input Dims, Input type and Concrete Inputs.\r\n\r\n### When called with a 0-dim tensor input, **`torch.aminmax`** would previously inconsistently return a 1D tensor output on CPU, but a 0D tensor output on CUDA. This has been fixed, so we consistently return a 0D tensor in both cases. (#96171).\r\n\r\nIn v2.0.1:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.aminmax(torch.tensor(1, device='cpu'), dim=0, keepdim=True)\r\n__main__:1: UserWarning: An output with one or more elements was resized since it had shape [], which does not match the required output shape [1]. This behavior is deprecated, and in a future PyTorch release outputs will not be resized unless they have zero elements. You can explicitly reuse an out tensor t by resizing it, inplace, to zero elements with t.resize_(0). (Triggered internally at ../aten/src/ATen/native/Resize.cpp:24.)\r\ntorch.return_types.aminmax(\r\nmin=tensor([1]),\r\nmax=tensor([1]))\r\n>>> torch.aminmax(torch.tensor(1, device='cpu'), dim=0, keepdim=False)\r\ntorch.return_types.aminmax(\r\nmin=tensor(1),\r\nmax=tensor(1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn v2.1.0:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.aminmax(torch.tensor(1, device='cpu'), dim=0, keepdim=True)\r\ntorch.return_types.aminmax(\r\nmin=tensor(1),\r\nmax=tensor(1))\r\n>>> torch.aminmax(torch.tensor(1, device='cpu'), dim=0, keepdim=False)\r\ntorch.return_types.aminmax(\r\nmin=tensor(1),\r\nmax=tensor(1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Change to the default behavior for custom operators registered to the dispatcher, that do not have anything registered to an Autograd dispatch key \r\n\r\nIf you have a custom operator that has a CPU/CUDA kernel registered to the CPU/CUDA dispatch key, but has no implementation at the Autograd key, then:\r\n\r\n**Old behavior:** When calling this operator with tensor inputs that require gradients, the tensor outputs would silently not require gradients.\r\n\r\n**New behavior:** When calling this operator with tensor inputs that do require gradients, the tensor outputs would require gradients (as long as the outputs are floating-point or complex), and will error if you try to backpropagate through them.\r\n\r\nThere is more information on how to recover the old behavior in the PR: (#104481, #105078) \r\n\r\n### `torch.autograd.Function` Raise an error if input is returned as-is and saved for forward or backward in `setup_context` (#98051)\r\n\r\nIf you are writing a custom autograd Function and you have implemented your autograd Function using `setup_context`, and if your forward function returns an input as-is as output, then saving that tensor for forward or backward now raises an error. You should return an alias of the input instead.\r\n\r\n#### 2.0.1\r\n```python\r\nclass Cube(torch.autograd.Function):\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def forward(x):\r\n        return x ** 3, x\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def setup_context(ctx, inputs, outputs):\r\n        cube, x = outputs\r\n        ctx.save_for_backward(x)\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def backward(ctx, grad_output, grad_x):\r\n        # NB: grad_x intentionally not used in computation\r\n        x, = ctx.saved_tensors\r\n        result = grad_output * 3 * x ** 2\r\n        return result\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2.1\r\n```\r\nclass Cube(torch.autograd.Function):\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def forward(x):\r\n        return x ** 3, x.view_as(x)\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n### Deprecate not specifying the `use_reentrant` flag explicitly when using `torch.utils.checkpoint` (#100551)\r\n\r\nIn PyTorch 2.1, if the `use_reentrant` flag is not explicitly passed, a warning is raised. To retain current behavior, pass `use_reentrant=True`. The default value will be updated to `use_reentrant=False` in the future.

In PyTorch 2.1, TorchScript switched its default fuser back to NNC. Additionally, `NVFuser` for TorchScript is now deprecated. Currently, users can still manually choose to use `NVFuser` instead of NNC, see [fuser options](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/v2.1.0-rc3/torch/csrc/jit/OVERVIEW.md#fusers) for details on how to do this.\r\n\r\n# New features\r\n## Release Engineering\r\n- Adding AArch64 wheel builds (#104109)\r\n- CUDA 12.1 support for PyTorch binaries (#107295)\r\n- Compile PyTorch on M1 natively (instead of cross compiling from x86) (#95719)\r\n- Enable UCC Distributed Communication Backend in CI (#100395)\r\n\r\n## Python Frontend\r\n- Enable `torch.device` to be used as a context manager to change the default device (#106514)\r\n- Add `torch.Tensor.dim_order` field to access current dimension permutation (#106835)\r\n- Add `torch.backends.cpu.get_cpu_capability()` to expose cpu properties (#100164)\r\n- Add support for `PrivateUse1` device (out of tree device) for untyped storage (#100868)\r\n- Add `torch._foreach_pow` (#92303)\r\n\r\n## optim\r\n- Provide **NAdamW** implementation through the `decoupled_weight_decay` flag (#103881, #107706)\r\n- Add xpu support for foreach kernels (#106021)\r\n- Add capturable API w/ tests + fix differentiable for **NAdam** (#106615)\r\n- Add pre hooks and post hooks for optimizer `load_state_dict()` and `state_dict()` (#105953, #106209)\r\n\r\n## torch.compile\r\n- Automatic dynamic shapes - `torch.compile` automatically finds dynamic dims and selectively turns on dynamism - (#106188, #98923)\r\n- Support Python 3.11 version with TorchDynamo - (#94098, #94099, #94100, #94101, #94102, #96499, #96500, #96501, #96503, #96504, #96495, #96505, #96506, #96508, #96509, #98032, #98364, #96511, #99934)\r\n- Introduce `TORCH_LOGS` to enable better logging UX for `torch.compile` - (#94858, #98564, #98776, #98795, #100664)\r\n- NumPy support in `torch.compile` (#106211)\r\n- Higher Order ops - TorchDynamo supports higher order ops - (#101707, #104685, #106425, #107459, #107461)\r\n\r\n## Sparse Frontend\r\n- Add prototype implementation of semi-structured (often known as 2:4 sparsity) for NVIDIA's Ampere, and newer, architecture at `torch.sparse.semi_structured` (#100485, #103700, #107398, #103978, #103830, #104608, #101339)\r\n\r\n## Autograd\r\n- Add backward support for out-of-place foreach functions  (#93901)\r\n- Add backward support for for in-place foreach functions (#96405)\r\n- Add backward support on `_foreach_zero_` (#101149)\r\n- Add forward mode AD to out-place foreach functions  (#106320)\r\n- Add forward over backward support for `torch.nn.functional.logsigmoid` (#99288)\r\n- Add forward mode AD to in-place foreach functions (#100695)\r\n- Add forward mode AD for `torch.renorm` (#100798)\r\n\r\n## torch.nn\r\n- Add an optional scale kwarg to `scaled_dot_product_attention` (#95259)\r\n- Add non-recursive `nn.Module.to_empty` option (#104197)\r\n- Add keyword argument to allow disabling bias for `LayerNorm` (#101683)\r\n- Add option to always call `nn.Module` global/non-global forward hooks (#104278)\r\n- Add keyword argument to allow disabling bias for `Transformer` (#101687)\r\n\r\n## torch.export\r\n- Add public APIs to `torch.export`: `export()` (#107609), `dynamic_dim()`(#107635), `constrain_as_{size,value}` APIs (#107735) and `ExportedProgram` (#107852)\r\n- Add support for saving and loading exported programs (#107309, #102707, #107924, #102708, #103274, #107818,\r\n#107938, #107420, #107666, #107386, #102716, #103273, #107888)\r\n- Add [ExportDB page](https://pytorch.org/docs/2.1/generated/exportdb/index.html#exportdb) in pytorch.org  ([#104288)\r\n- Add a verifier for EXIR Aten dialect (#94783, #100019)\r\n\r\n## functorch\r\n- Add experimental support for functorch transforms and `torch.compile` composition (#98328, #106610, #107462, and others)\r\n- Add `functorch.einops.rearrange` (#101957) \r\n\r\n## Distributed\r\n### c10d\r\n- Add `PrivateUse1` for dispatching PyTorch Distributed Collectives to support custom device.

Some important points:\r\n\r\n- Heavy work our sympy-based symbolic reasoning system, including value ranges analysis for proving redundant constraints (#95174, #105877, #104968, #105138, #105139, #97963, #96121, #104557, #106644(https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/106644 ), #94944)\r\n- Improved symbolic tracing support for operators, including SymInt\u2019ified schemas and SymInt aware operator/backward implementations (#95543, #96100, #97362, #97675) Some specific operators: \r\n    - tile (#106933)\r\n    - randint/randperm (#98968) \r\n    - roll (#99114)\r\n    - fft ops (#99115)\r\n    - philox_rand (#99290)\r\n- Avoid overspecializing in situations where it is not necessary (#96008)\r\n- Don't attempt to use fake tensor fallback to real tensor if there are symbolic sizes (#97148)\r\n- Make `Tensor.__contains__` accept `SymInt/Float/Bool`. (#98933)\r\n- Change Dynamo to not duck-size unspecialized ints (#99010)\r\n- Improved mixed type handling for SymInts (#100008, #100328)\r\n- Support for annotating that SymInts have a constrained range (#103346)\r\n- Don't generate guards that refer to unbacked SymInts (#95732)\r\n- Automatically guard when SymInt is converted to int, instead of erroring (#95479)\r\n- Z3 based translation validation for debugging symbolic reasoning problems (#104827, #106643, #107523, #106645, #101307, #101607)\r\n- Improve constraint violation error reporting, including recommended constraints for export (#102729(https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/102729 ), #102198, #107470, #107790(https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/107790 ), #100745, #101636, #101815)\r\n- Improve logs for dynamic shapes using TORCH_LOGS=dynamic (#99277, #98941, #107439)\r\n- If we can't statically prove 32-bit indexing is OK, only add guard if hint exists (#106004)\r\n- Add expect_true for irrefutable guards, greatly improving overall support for error checking involving unbacked ints, and other unbacked symint improvements (#106720, #95216, #106788)\r\n- Support for torch.compile with FakeTensor that has SymInt sizes (#107662)\r\n\r\n### Other bug fixes\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have the following fixes broken down into roughly 4 parts:\r\n\r\n- Primtorch and decomposition bugfixes and improvements\r\n- FakeTensor and meta function bugfixes and improvements\r\n- AOTAutograd bugfixes and improvements\r\n- General \u201ccomposability\u201d bugfixes.\r\n\r\nThe first three cover a large number of general improvements to torch.compile, since torch.compile captures a graph internally by using these major components (fake tensor, prims and decomps, and AOTAutograd, see docs(https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0/)).\r\n\r\n### Primtorch and decompositions bugfixes\r\n\r\nThere were a large number of fixes to the primtorch and ref decompositions, which are used in torch.compile during graph capture. These all fixed quite a few bugs in torch.compile:\r\n\r\n- Sub.scalar decomp: fix primtorch handling for with alpha and float64 arg (#95421)\r\n- Embedding_backward_dense decomp: broadcasting fix (#95499)\r\n- Upsample_bilinear decomp fix (#101682)\r\n- Batch_norm decomp reduce computation when weight or bias is none (#104616)\r\n- _unsafe_index decomp (#106814)\r\n- `Hardshrink`: make decomp composite implicit (#107039)\r\n- normal op decomposition for specializations of the normal op (#106792)\r\n- matmul decomp: update to match eager (#105850)\r\n- prims.collapse: make it a real prim (#91748)\r\n- Diagonal, linalg.diagonal: add refs (#95774)\r\n- addmv decomp (#96264)\r\n- Minimum_value: fix schema (#97327)\r\n- squeeze.dims decomp (#97020)\r\n- cumprod decomp: add ref (#98670)\r\n- Prims.unbind: fix ref if given dimension size is 0 (#100122)\r\n- Aten.arange.default: decompose to to arange.start_step (#99739)\r\n- Philox_rand: add decomps (#100206)\r\n- Elu_backward: fix bad accuracy in decomp (#100284)\r\n- polar decomp: add ref (#100345)\r\n- Batch_norm decomp: fix decomp  when weight/bias is not flattened (#101059)\r\n- aten.fill.Tensor decomp: don\u2019t call .item() (#103880)\r\n- Torch.renorm: add decomp (#103858)\r\n- multi_margin_loss ops: add decomps (#104578)\r\n- aten.logspace decomp: bugfix (#105201)\r\n- multilabel_margin_loss_forward op: add decomps (#105302)\r\n- Torch.{stft,istft} decomps: add ref (#106400)\r\n- Aten.rrelu_with_noise decomp: add ref (#106812)\r\n- Misc fixes:\r\n    - better error message when functionalization cant handle op (#95392)\r\n    - Simplify some decompositions. (#107038)\r\n    - Make the glue compute short circuit only if possible (#94437)\r\n    - Don't use PrimTorch decomposition for empty (#94512)\r\n    - Remove unnecessary TensorMeta rewrap (#95004)\r\n\r\n### FakeTensor and Meta function fixes\r\nFake Tensors and meta functions are used internally to perform \u201cshape inference\u201d during graph capture when running torch.compile. In particular: when we capture a graph of pytorch operators, we\u2019d like detailed information on the shapes of intermediate and output tensors in the graph.

PyTorch 2.0 offers the same eager-mode development and user experience, while fundamentally changing and supercharging how PyTorch operates at compiler level under the hood with faster performance and support for Dynamic Shapes and Distributed.\r\n\r\nThis next-generation release includes a Stable version of Accelerated Transformers (formerly called Better Transformers); Beta includes torch.compile as the main API for PyTorch 2.0, the scaled_dot_product_attention function as part of torch.nn.functional, the MPS backend, functorch APIs in the torch.func module; and other Beta/Prototype improvements across various inferences, performance and training optimization features on GPUs and CPUs. For a comprehensive introduction and technical overview of torch.compile, please visit the 2.0 [Get Started page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2.0).\r\n\r\nAlong with 2.0, we are also releasing a series of beta updates to the PyTorch domain libraries, including those that are in-tree, and separate libraries including TorchAudio, TorchVision, and TorchText. An update for TorchX is also being released as it moves to community supported mode. More details can be found in this [library blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/new-library-updates-in-pytorch-2.0/).\r\n\r\nThis release is composed of over 4,541 commits and 428 contributors since 1.13.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.0 and the overall 2-series this year.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n- torch.compile is the main API for PyTorch 2.0, which wraps your model and returns a compiled model. It is a fully additive (and optional) feature and hence 2.0 is 100% backward compatible by definition.\r\n- As an underpinning technology of torch.compile, TorchInductor with Nvidia and AMD GPUs will rely on OpenAI Triton deep learning compiler to generate performant code and hide low level hardware details. OpenAI Triton-generated kernels achieve performance that's on par with hand-written kernels and specialized cuda libraries such as cublas.\r\n- Accelerated Transformers introduce high-performance support for training and inference using a custom kernel architecture for scaled dot product attention (SPDA). The API is integrated with torch.compile() and model developers may also use the [scaled dot product attention](https://pytorch.org/docs/2.0/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html) kernels directly by calling the new scaled_dot_product_attention() operator.\r\n- Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend provides GPU accelerated PyTorch training on Mac platforms with added support for Top 60 most used ops, bringing coverage to over 300 operators.\r\n- Amazon AWS optimize the PyTorch CPU inference on AWS Graviton3 based [C7g instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-c7g-instances-powered-by-aws-graviton3-processors/). PyTorch 2.0 improves inference performance on Graviton compared to the previous releases, including improvements for Resnet50 and Bert.\r\n- New prototype features and technologies across TensorParallel, DTensor, 2D parallel, TorchDynamo, AOTAutograd, PrimTorch and TorchInductor.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n<strong>Stable</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td><strong>Beta</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td><strong>Prototype</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td><strong>Platform Changes</strong>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>Accelerated PT 2 Transformers\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.compile\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>DTensor\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>CUDA support for 11.7 & 11.8 (deprecating CUDA 11.6)\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>PyTorch MPS Backend\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>TensorParallel\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Python 3.8 (deprecating Python 3.7)\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Scaled dot product attention\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>2D Parallel\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>AWS Graviton3\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Functorch\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td rowspan=\"2\" >Torch.compile (dynamic=True)\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>Dispatchable Collectives\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>torch.set_default_device and torch.device as context manager\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>X86 quantization backend\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>GNN inference and training performance\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n   <td>\r\n   </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\\*To see a full list of public 2.0, 1.13 and 1.12 feature submissions click[ here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H3jazwO8BBCwK8JwLNYspLiHfUrzshEtyqjL-X93I9g/edit#gid=790902532)\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n\r\n### **Drop support for Python versions <= 3.7 (#93155)**\r\n\r\nPreviously the minimum supported version of Python for PyTorch was 3.7. This PR updates the minimum version to require 3.8 in order to install PyTorch. See [Hardware / Software Support ](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/893aa5df3f2a475c91ea8eadb1353812e52fb227/RELEASE.md#python) for more information.\r\n\r\n### **Drop support for CUDA 10 (#89582)**\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the minimum CUDA version to 11.0. See the [getting-started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for installation or [building from source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source) for more information.\r\n\r\n### **Gradients are now set to `None` instead of zeros by default in `torch.optim.*.zero_grad()` and `torch.nn.Module.zero_grad()` (#92731)**\r\n\r\nThis changes the default behavior of `zero_grad()` to zero out the grads by setting them to `None` instead of zero tensors. In other words, the `set_to_none` kwarg is now `True` by default instead of `False`. Setting grads to `None` reduces peak memory usage and increases performance. This will break code that directly accesses data or does computation on the grads after calling `zero_grad()` as they will now be `None`. To revert to the old behavior, pass in `zero_grad(set_to_none=False)`.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>1.13</th>\r\n<th>2.0</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> from torch import nn\r\n>>> module = nn.Linear(2,22)\r\n>>> i = torch.randn(2, 2, requires_grad=True)\r\n>>> module(i).sum().backward()\r\n>>> module.zero_grad()\r\n>>> module.weight.grad == None\r\nFalse\r\n>>> module.weight.grad.data\r\ntensor([[0., 0.],\r\n        [0., 0.]])\r\n>>> module.weight.grad + 1.0\r\ntensor([[1., 1.],\r\n        [1., 1.]])\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> from torch import nn\r\n>>> module = nn.Linear(5, 5)\r\n>>> i = torch.randn(2, 5, requires_grad=True)\r\n>>> module(i).sum().backward()\r\n>>> module.zero_grad()\r\n>>> module.weight.grad == None\r\nTrue\r\n>>> module.weight.grad.data\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'data'\r\n>>> module.weight.grad + 1.0\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +:\r\n'NoneType' and 'float'\r\n```\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### **Update `torch.tensor` and `nn.Parameter` to serialize all their attributes (#88913)**\r\n\r\nAny attribute stored on `torch.tensor` and `torch.nn.Parameter` will now be serialized.

However, this change can potentially be backward incompatible since there may be small numerical differences between the results computed with the `foreach` implementation and the previous default. The foreach implementation will be the default only if the following conditions are met.\r\n\r\n1. The user has not specified kwargs relating to implementation (`foreach`, `fused`, or `differentiable`),\r\n2. All tensors are native tensors (not subclasses) and on CUDA,\r\n3. `torch.jit.is_scripting` is `False`.\r\n\r\nWhen these conditions are satisfied, the implementation used will match the implementation used when one passes `foreach=True`. The user defined flag for `foreach` will NOT be overwritten in order to preserve user selections. For more details, check the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#algorithms). There should be no significant differences between the results returned by these optimizers. To revert to the old behavior, say, for `adam`, pass in `adam(..., foreach=False, ...)` or initialize `Adam` with `Adam(..., foreach=False, ...)`.\r\n\r\nPull Requests: #92306, #92716, #92723,#92724, #92726, #92727, #92728, #92715, #91896, #92730, #90865, #93184, #92181, #92923, #95415, #95818, #95811\r\n\r\n### **`torch.nn.utils.stateless.functional_call` now respects tied weights (#90477)**\r\n\r\nAssume a module has two tied weights, x and x_tied.

Instead, we represent the observer constraints for\r\nfixed qparams ops through the existing DTypeWithConstraints mechanism. Note that, however, to be consistent with other DTypeWithConstraints checks, we no longer throw an error if an incorrect observer is specified, but simply ignore the offending QConfig and log a warning instead.

(#92023, #91452, #91222, #90037, #90077, #90966, #89860, #91211, #92030)\r\n- Add support for linearize a-la [jax.linearize](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.linearize.html#jax.linearize) (#94173)\r\n- Add torch.func.functional_call, a new utility function to work with NN modules. (#89213)\r\n- Add torch.func.stack_module_state, a new utility function to help with model ensembling (#88850)\r\n\r\n## Cuda\r\n\r\n- Introduce CUDA Device Assertions Infrastructure (#84609)\r\n- `Logcumsumexp` for complex dtypes for CUDA (build-time optimized) (#94310)\r\n- Caching allocator tracing (#86241)\r\n- Add Pluggable CUDA allocator backend (#86786)\r\n- Add cudaMallocAsync as an alternative backend for the CUDA allocator (#82682)\r\n\r\n## Cpp API\r\n\r\n- Add `set_to_none` flag for C++ optim endpoint (#92989)\r\n\r\n## NestedTensor API\r\n\r\n- Add support for `tensor.to()` for NestedTensor backend (#87146)\r\n- Add backwards support for `gelu` and `relu` operators (#94776)\r\n- Add support for `torch.neg` operator (#88131)\r\n\r\n## Distributed\r\n\r\n- Distributed Tensor (Prototype Release)\r\n  - PyTorch [DistributedTensor](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/distributed/_tensor/README.md) (DTensor) is a prototyping effort with distributed tensor primitives to allow easier distributed computation authoring in the SPMD (Single Program Multiple Devices) paradigm. The primitives are simple but powerful when used to express tensor distributions with both sharded and replicated parallelism strategies. PyTorch DTensor empowered PyTorch [Tensor Parallelism](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/distributed.tensor.parallel.html) along with other advanced parallelism explorations. In addition, it also offers a uniform way to save/load state_dict for distributed checkpointing purposes, even when there\u2019re complex tensor distribution strategies such as combining tensor parallelism with parameter sharding in FSDP. (#88176, #88177, #88178, #88179, #88551, #88549, #88550, #89800, #89967, #89968, #89991, #90106, #90241, #90449, #90731, #90732, #90733, #90734, #90735, #91756, #91783, #91785, #91801, #91802, #92069, #92197, #92198, #92290, #92611, #92651, #92652, #92677, #93040, #93160, #93306, #93832, #93957, #94517, #94524)\r\n  - We also design and implement Tensor Parallel & 2D Parallel (Tensor Parallel + FSDP) on top of DistributedTensor. (#88180, #89242, #89467, #89535, #89779, #89878, #93029, #93412, #94421, #94748)\r\n- Distributed Checkpoint\r\n  - PyTorch Distributed Checkpointing (DCP) API was first introduced in PyTorch 1.13 and this will be an official prototype release in PyTorch 2.0. The distributed checkpoint API in PT2.0 decouples the storage layer from the checkpoint planning layer. Planner types are introduced to perform the coordination of storage both locally and globally to plan the save/load process. Checkpointing support for FSDP `sharded_state_dict` is added as well.

For users, this feature will allow for code that runs on both GPU and CPU machines without having to change the backend specification. The dispatchability feature will also allow users to perform both GPU and CPU collectives using the same ProcessGroup, as PyTorch will automatically find an appropriate backend for the tensor type (as of PyTorch 2.0, the default is NCCL for CUDA and Gloo for CPU). Existing backend specifications by users will be honored and will not require change (#83679, #83735, #83810, #83859, #83876, #83916, #84423, #86166, #86368, #86407, #86408, #86409, #88351, #88846, #88889, #88903, #89317, #89318, #89505, #89813, #88330, #91257, #91172)\r\n\r\n## Mps\r\n\r\n- Add native support for:`torch.nn.functional.group_norm`(#91190), `torch.var_mean` (#91190), `torch.nansym`(#93845), `torch.frac`(#86625), `torch.signbit`(#87214), `torch.exp1m`(#87147), `torch.cumsum`(#88319), `torch.trace`(#87910), `torch.nn.Hardswish` (#87952),`torch.inverse`(#90428), `torch.floor_divide`(#91126), `unfold`(#91266), `bincount`(#91267), `nonzero`(#91616), `norm_dtype`and`cdist`(#91643), `unique`and`unique_consecutive`(#88532), `nan_to_num`(#91110), `torch.linalg.cross`(#91642), `randperm`(#91708), `triangular_solve`(#94345), `grid_sampler2d`(#94273), `remainder`(#92139), `addr`(#94538), `fmod`(#94722), `repeat_interleave` (#88649),`sort`and`argSort`(#94697),`range` (#91075)\r\n- Add functions to handle rng and force device synchronization `torch.mps.{get_rng_state, set_rng_state, synchronize, manual_seed, seed}` (#94417)\r\n- Add support for the `mps` device for `torch.Generator` (#91348)\r\n- Add `torch.int64` support for unary ops (#86615)\r\n\r\n## Profiler\r\n\r\n- Improve Memory Profiler(alpha): enhancement to the existing memory profiler that can attribute memory consumptions to activations, gradients, parameters, and optimizer states (#86802, #86853, #86854, #86880, #87006, #87566, #87567, #87568, #88924, #88925, #88926, #89355, #89356, #86355, #88917, #87133, #86753, #86754, #87096, #86909, #87825)\r\n- Add Linux perf event support in profiler (#87866, #87874)\r\n\r\n## Foreach API\r\n\r\n- Implement:\r\n  - `torch._foreach_lerp` (#87562),\r\n  - `fused adamw` (#88015)\r\n  - `_foreach_addc`(div/mul)(\\_).Tensor (#88157)\r\n  - `clamp_min` `clamp_max` (#91384)\r\n  - `adamw` (#88015)\r\n\r\n## Mobile\r\n\r\n- Add XNNPACK Delegate Framework.\r\n  - Enable a XNNPACK graph to be built from the torchscript IR and performing checks (#86980, #87128, #87824)\r\n  - Add flatbuffer serialization support (#87826, #87906, #87907, #87908)\r\n  - Create `Executor` and `Compiler` classes which compiles the XNNPACK graph and preps for execution (#88779, #88778, #88780, #89090)\r\n  - Optimize library includes (#88863, #89231)\r\n  - Add Constant Data which will be used in Convolution (#89445)\r\n- Add support for better benchmarking\r\n  - Add support in lite_predictor benchmark binary to select event lists and perform benchmarking using Linux perf through Kineto profiler (#87876)\r\n  - List all missing ops at once (#94205)\r\n\r\n## Sparse API\r\n\r\n- Add `torch.sparse.check_sparse_tensor_invariants` context manager that allows users to opt into more checks at runtime for better debugging.

    "body": "# Pytorch 1.13 Release Notes\r\n\r\n* Highlights\r\n* Backwards Incompatible Changes\r\n* New Features\r\n* Improvements\r\n* Performance\r\n* Documentation\r\n* Developers\r\n\r\n# Highlights\r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce the release of PyTorch 1.13! This includes stable versions of BetterTransformer. We deprecated CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 and completed migration of CUDA 11.6 and 11.7. Beta includes improved support for Apple M1 chips and functorch, a library that offers composable vmap (vectorization) and autodiff transforms, being included in-tree with the PyTorch release. This release is composed of over 3,749 commits and 467 contributors since 1.12.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n* The BetterTransformer feature set supports fastpath execution for common Transformer models during Inference out-of-the-box, without the need to modify the model. Additional improvements include accelerated add+matmul linear algebra kernels for sizes commonly used in Transformer models and Nested Tensors is now enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* Timely deprecating older CUDA versions allows us to proceed with introducing the latest CUDA version as they are introduced by Nvidia\u00ae, and hence allows support for C++17 in PyTorch and new NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.\r\n\r\n* Previously, functorch was released out-of-tree in a separate package. After installing PyTorch, a user will be able to `import functorch` and use functorch without needing to install another package.\r\n\r\n* PyTorch is offering native builds for Apple\u00ae silicon machines that use Apple's new M1 chip as a beta feature, providing improved support across PyTorch's APIs.\r\n\r\n|Stable\t|Beta\t|Prototype\t|\r\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\r\n|<ul><li>Better Transformer</li><li>CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 CI/CD Deprecation </li></ul> | <ul><li>Enable Intel\u00ae VTune\u2122 Profiler's Instrumentation and Tracing Technology APIs</li><li>Extend NNC to support channels last and bf16</li><li>Functorch now in PyTorch Core Library</li><li>Beta Support for M1 devices</li></ul>\t| <ul><li>Arm\u00ae Compute Library backend support for AWS Graviton</li><li> CUDA Sanitizer</li></ul> |\r\n\r\nYou can check the blogpost that shows the new features [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/PyTorch-1.13-release/).\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n### **uint8 and all integer dtype masks are no longer allowed in Transformer** **(#87106)**\r\n\r\nPrior to 1.13, `key_padding_mask` could be set to uint8 or other integer dtypes in `TransformerEncoder` and `MultiheadAttention`, which might generate unexpected results. In this release, these dtypes are not allowed for the mask anymore. Please convert them to `torch.bool` before using.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(2, 4, 2)\r\n>>> encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(layer, 2)\r\n>>> pad_mask = torch.tensor([[1, 1, 0, 0]], dtype=torch.uint8)\r\n>>> inputs = torch.cat([torch.randn(1, 2, 2), torch.zeros(1, 2, 2)], dim=1)\r\n# works before 1.13\r\n>>> outputs = encoder(inputs, src_key_padding_mask=pad_mask)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(2, 4, 2)\r\n>>> encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(layer, 2)\r\n>>> pad_mask = torch.tensor([[1, 1, 0, 0]], dtype=torch.bool)\r\n>>> inputs = torch.cat([torch.randn(1, 2, 2), torch.zeros(1, 2, 2)], dim=1)\r\n>>> outputs = encoder(inputs, src_key_padding_mask=pad_mask)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Updated `torch.floor_divide` to perform floor division** **(#78411)**\r\n\r\nPrior to 1.13, `torch.floor_divide` erroneously performed truncation division (i.e. truncated the quotients). In this release, it has been fixed to perform floor division. To replicate the old behavior, use `torch.div` with `rounding_mode='trunc'`.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([4.0, -3.0])\r\n>>> b = torch.tensor([2.0, 2.0])\r\n>>> torch.floor_divide(a, b)\r\ntensor([ 2., -1.])\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([4.0, -3.0])\r\n>>> b = torch.tensor([2.0, 2.0])\r\n>>> torch.floor_divide(a, b)\r\ntensor([ 2., -2.])\r\n# Old behavior can be replicated using torch.div with rounding_mode='trunc'\r\n>>> torch.div(a, b, rounding_mode='trunc')\r\ntensor([ 2., -1.])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Fixed `torch.index_select` on CPU to error that index is out of bounds when the `source` tensor is empty (#77881)**\r\n\r\nPrior to 1.13, `torch.index_select` would return an appropriately sized tensor filled with random values on CPU if the source tensor was empty. In this release, we have fixed this bug so that it errors out. A consequence of this is that `torch.nn.Embedding` which utilizes `index_select` will error out rather than returning an empty tensor when `embedding_dim=0` and `input` contains indices which are out of bounds. The old behavior cannot be reproduced with `torch.nn.Embedding`, however since an Embedding layer with `embedding_dim=0` is a corner case this behavior is unlikely to be relied upon.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> t = torch.tensor([4], dtype=torch.long)\r\n>>> embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(3, 0)\r\n>>> embedding(t)\r\ntensor([], size=(1, 0), grad_fn=<EmbeddingBackward0>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> t = torch.tensor([4], dtype=torch.long)\r\n>>> embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(3, 0)\r\n>>> embedding(t)\r\nRuntimeError: INDICES element is out of DATA bounds, id=4 axis_dim=3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Disallow overflows when tensors are constructed from scalars (#82329)\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, overflows during tensor construction from scalars would not throw an error. In 1.13, such cases will error.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.tensor(1000, dtype=torch.int8)\r\ntensor(-24, dtype=torch.int8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.tensor(1000, dtype=torch.int8)\r\nRuntimeError: value cannnot be converted to type int8 without overflow\r\n```\r\n\r\n### **Error on indexing a cpu tensor with non-cpu indices (#69607)**\r\n\r\nPrior to 1.13, `cpu_tensor[cuda_indices]` was a valid program that would return a cpu tensor. The original use case for mixed device indexing was for `non_cpu_tensor[cpu_indices]`, and allowing the opposite was unintentional (`cpu_tensor[non_cpu_indices]`). This behavior appears to be rarely used, and a refactor of our indexing kernels made it difficult to represent an op that takes in (cpu_tensor, non_cpu_tensor) and returns another cpu_tensor, so it is now an error.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the old behavior for `base[indices]`, you can ensure that either `indices` lives on the CPU device, or `base` and `indices` both live on the same device.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\r\n>>> b = torch.tensor([0, 2], device='cuda')\r\n>>> a[b]\r\ntensor([1., 3.])\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\r\n>>> b = torch.tensor([0, 2], device='cuda')\r\n>>> a[b]\r\nRuntimeError: indices should be either on cpu or on the same device as the indexed tensor (cpu)\r\n# Old behavior can be replicated by moving b to CPU, or a to CUDA\r\n>>> a[b.cpu()]\r\ntensor([1., 3.])\r\n>>> a.cuda()[b]\r\ntensor([1., 3.], device='cuda:0')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `torch.eig`,` torch.matrix_rank`, `torch.lstsq` (#70982, #70981, #70980)\r\nThe deprecation cycle for the above functions has been completed and they have been removed in the 1.13 release.\r\n\r\n## torch.nn\r\n\r\n### Enforce that the `bias` has the same dtype as `input` and `weight` for convolutions on CPU (#83686)\r\n\r\nTo align with the implementation on other devices, the CPU implementation for convolutions was updated to enforce that the `dtype` of the `bias` matches the `dtype` of the `input` and `weight`.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# input and weight are dtype torch.int64\r\n# bias is torch.float32\r\n>>> out = torch.nn.functional.conv2d(input, weight, bias, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# input and weight are dtype torch.int64\r\n# bias is torch.float32\r\n>>> with assertRaisesError():\r\n>>>    out = torch.nn.functional.conv2d(input, weight, bias, ...)\r\n\r\n# Updated code to avoid the error\r\n>>> out = torch.nn.functional.conv2d(input, weight, bias.to(input.dtype), ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Autograd\r\n\r\n### Disallow setting the `.data` of a tensor that `requires_grad=True` with an integer tensor (#78436)\r\n\r\nSetting the  `.data` of a tensor that `requires_grad` with an integer tensor now raises an error.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> x = torch.randn(2, requires_grad=True)\r\n>>> x.data = torch.randint(1, (2,))\r\n>>> x\r\ntensor([0, 0], requires_grad=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> x = torch.randn(2, requires_grad=True)\r\n>>> x.data = torch.randint(1, (2,))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nRuntimeError: data set to a tensor that requires gradients must be floating point or complex dtype\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Added variable_list support to ExtractVariables struct (#84583)\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, C++ custom autograd Function considers tensors passed in TensorList to not be tensors for the purposes of recording the backward graph. After this change, custom Functions that receive TensorList must modify their backward functions to also compute gradients for these additional tensor inputs. Note that this behavior now differs from that of custom autograd Functions in Python.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct MyFunction : public Function<MyFunction> {\r\n    static Variable forward(AutogradContext* ctx, at::Tensor t, at::TensorList tensors) {\r\n      return 2 * tensors[0] + 3 * t;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static variable_list backward(\r\n        AutogradContext* ctx,\r\n        variable_list grad_output) {\r\n      return {3 * grad_output[0]};\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct MyFunction : public Function<MyFunction> {\r\n    static Variable forward(AutogradContext* ctx, at::Tensor t, at::TensorList tensors) {\r\n      return 2 * tensors[0] + 3 * t;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static variable_list backward(\r\n        AutogradContext* ctx,\r\n        variable_list grad_output) {\r\n      return {3 * grad_output[0], 2 * grad_output[0]};\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Don't detach when making views; force kernel to detach (#84893)\r\n\r\nView operations registered as CompositeExplicitAutograd kernels are no longer allowed to return input tensors as-is. You must explicitly create a new tensor (e.g., using `.alias()`).\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ntorch::Tensor view_op(const torch::Tensor& self) {\r\n  return self;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ntorch::Tensor view_op(const torch::Tensor& self) {\r\n  return self.alias();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ONNX\r\n\r\n### `torch.onnx.register_custom_op_symbolic` now only registers the symbolic function at the specified opset version (#85636)\r\n\r\nThis updates `register_custom_op_symbolic`'s behavior to *only register the symbolic function at a single version.* This is more aligned with the semantics of the API signature. Previously the API registers a symbolic function to *all* versions up to the specified version. As a result of this change, users will need to register a symbolic function to the exact version when they want to override an existing symbolic function. Users are not affected if (1) an implementation does not exist for the op, or (2) the symbolic function is already registering to the exact version for export.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Assuming an implemented symbolic function `custom_op_function`\r\ntorch.onnx.register_custom_op_symbolic(\"aten::foo\", custom_op_function, 16)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Assuming an implemented symbolic function `custom_op_function`\r\nfor opset in range(1, 17):\r\n    torch.onnx.register_custom_op_symbolic(\"aten::foo\", custom_op_function, opset)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Default ONNX opset is updated to 14 (#83284)\r\n\r\nThe update is done in regularly to ensure we are in sync with the onnx updates. Users can specify `opset_version` in `torch.onnx.export` to maintain opset version 13.\r\n\r\n### `torch.onnx.symbolic_registry` is removed (#84382)\r\n\r\nWe removed the `symbolic_registry` module and hid it as an internal implementation detail. Users previously relying on the `register_op` function to register custom symbolic functions should move to use the `torch.onnx.register_custom_op_symbolic` API.\r\n\r\n### `ScalarType` and global variables in `torch.onnx.symbolic_helper` are removed (#82995)\r\n\r\nThe `ScalarType` class in `torch.onnx.symbolic_helper`, along with the global variables `cast_pytorch_to_onnx`, `pytorch_name_to_type`, `scalar_name_to_pytorch`, `scalar_type_to_onnx` and `scalar_type_to_pytorch_type` are removed from the module.

However, in the C++ API, `torch::randint` would default to the global default data type, which is usually `float`. In 1.13 we changed the default for `dtype` in the C++ API to `int64` in order to match the python API.

In this release, it resolves to the `{std, var, std_mean, var_mean}.dim` overload. With the `.correction` overload, the third argument of type `int64_t` could be used to pass a correction *\u03b4N* other than 1. In order to call the `{std, var, std_mean, var_mean}.correction` overload in 1.13, the old `int64_t` argument can be wrapped in a `c10::optional`.\r\n\r\n1.12.1\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// using std as an example\r\nint64_t correction = 2;\r\ntorch::std(t, /*dim=*/dim, /*correction=*/correction, /*keepdim=*/True);\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.13\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// To replicate in 1.13 using std as an example\r\nauto correction = c10::make_optional<int64_t>(2);\r\ntorch::std(t, /*dim=*/dim, /*correction=*/correction, /*keepdim=*/True);\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n## Distributed\r\n\r\nWe are deprecating the following APIs of c10d: `*_coalesced` APIs (#85959), `*_multigpu` APIs (#85961) and `ProcessGroupRoundRobin` (#85158)\r\n\r\nWe added warnings when users call c10d\u2019s `*_coalesced`, `*_multigpu` and `ProcessGroupRoundRobin` APIs.

Users should use only the `op()` and `at()` methods of the `GraphContext` object, as other fields in the class will change in future releases.\r\n\r\n# New features\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n* Added a deterministic implementation of `scatter_add` on CUDA for all input sizes (#79466)\r\n* Added `torch.concatenate` that aliases `torch.cat` (#85073)\r\n* Added `Tensor.is_cpu()`  that returns whether a tensor is on CPU (#78887)\r\n* Added a `force` kwarg to `Tensor.numpy()` that enables returning a numpy `ndarray` that does not share storage with the tensor (#78564)\r\n* Added `torch.special.{airy_ai, bessel_j0, bessel_j1, bessel_y0, bessel_y1, modified_bessel_i0, modified_bessel_i1, modified_bessel_k0, modified_bessel_k1, scaled_modified_bessel_k0, scaled_modified_bessel_k1, spherical_bessel_j0}` (#78900), (#78901), (#78902), (#78912),  (#78451)\r\n* Added `torch.special.{chebyshev_polynomial_t, chebyshev_polynomial_u, chebyshev_polynomial_v, chebyshev_polynomial_w, hermite_polynomial_h, hermite_polynomial_he, laguerre_polynomial_l, legendre_polynomial_p, shifted_chebyshev_polynomial_t, shifted_chebyshev_polynomial_u, shifted_chebyshev_polynomial_v, shifted_chebyshev_polynomial_w}` (#78196), (#78293), (#78304),  (#78366), (#78352),  (#78357)\r\n* Added `weights_only` option to `torch.load` that restricts load to state_dict only, enabling safe loading.

Models can use features such as DDP, FSDP and ShardedTensor and they can have a different configuration between saving and loading - for example, save from 4 hosts and load from a single host. Distributed checkpointing has an extensibility API that enables full control of how a model is saved; and a pluggable IO backend.

This makes it simpler to leverage activation checkpointing to reduce memory footprint of your training applications and train larger models.

They are similar to their `__torch_function__` and `__torch_dispatch__` counterparts, but can be used as context managers that intercept **all** torch operator calls, including factory functions. These API\u2019s are still experimental and aren\u2019t quite user facing yet, and we will add more documentation as they are hardened. See [this post](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/what-and-why-is-torch-dispatch/557) for more details.   (#78214, #78822, #78847, #84774, #83925, #79143, #77667, #80992, #80995, #80998, #82647, #83372)\r\n* A large amount of hardening to `FakeTensor` and `FakeTensorMode`, a `__torch_dispatch__` style mode that allows you to run shape/dtype/device inference. This is similar to the \u201cmeta\u201d device, but fake tensors also faithfully store device metadata, and the logic lives in python.

This release is composed of over 3124 commits, 433 contributors. Along with 1.12, we are releasing beta versions of AWS S3 Integration, PyTorch Vision Models on Channels Last on CPU, Empowering PyTorch on Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable processors with Bfloat16 and FSDP API. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n* Functional Module API to functionally apply module computation with a given set of parameters\r\n* Complex32 and Complex Convolutions in PyTorch \r\n* DataPipes from TorchData fully backward compatible with DataLoader \r\n* Functorch with improved coverage for APIs\r\n* nvFuser a deep learning compiler for PyTorch\r\n* Changes to float32 matrix multiplication precision on Ampere and later CUDA hardware\r\n* TorchArrow, a new beta library for machine learning preprocessing over batch data\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n**Updated type promotion for `torch.clamp`** ([#77035](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/77035))\r\n\r\nIn 1.11, the \u2018min\u2019 and \u2018max\u2019 arguments in `torch.clamp` did not participate in type promotion, which made it inconsistent with `minimum` and `maximum` operations.

This may affect users on Ampere or later CUDA devices and TPUs. See the PyTorch [blog](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-and-tensorfloat32/504) for more details. \r\n\r\n## Sparse\r\n\r\n### Use ScatterGatherKernel for scatter_reduce (CPU-only) ([#74226](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/74226), [#74608](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/74608))\r\n\r\nIn 1.11.0, unlike `scatter` which takes a `reduce` kwarg or `scatter_add`, `scatter_reduce` was not an in-place function. That is, it did not allow the user to pass an output tensor which contains data that is reduced together with the scattered data. Instead, the scatter reduction took place on an output tensor initialized under the hood. Indices of the output that were not scattered to were filled with reduction inits (or 0 for options \u2018amin\u2019 and \u2018amax\u2019).\r\n\r\nIn 1.12.0, `scatter_reduce` (which is in beta) is in-place to align with the API of the related existing functions `scatter`/`scatter_add`. For this reason, the argument `input` in 1.11.0 has been renamed `src` in 1.12.0 and the new `self` argument now takes a destination tensor to be scattered onto. Since the destination tensor is no longer initialized under the hood, the `output_size` kwarg in 1.11.0 that allowed users to specify the size of the output at dimension `dim` has been removed. Further, in 1.12.0 we introduce an `include_self` kwarg which determines whether values in the `self` (destination) tensor are included in the reduction. Setting `include_self=True` could, for example, allow users to provide special reduction inits for the scatter_reduction operation. Otherwise, if `include_self=False,` indices scattered to are treated as if they were filled with reduction inits.\r\n\r\nIn the snippet below, we illustrate how the behavior of `scatter_reduce` in 1.11.0 can be achieved with the function released in 1.12.0.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> src = torch.arange(6, dtype=torch.float).reshape(3, 2)\r\n>>> index = torch.tensor([[0, 2], [1, 1], [0, 0]])\r\n>>> dim = 1\r\n>>> output_size = 4\r\n>>> reduce = \"prod\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.11\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.scatter_reduce(src, dim, index, reduce, output_size=output_size)\r\n`tensor([[ 0., 1., 1., 1.],\r\n        [ 1., 6., 1., 1.],\r\n        [20., 1., 1., 1.]])`\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.12\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> output_shape = list(src.shape)\r\n>>> output_shape[dim] = output_size\r\n# reduction init for prod is 1\r\n# filling the output with 1 is only necessary if the user wants to preserve the behavior in 1.11\r\n# where indices not scattered to are filled with reduction inits\r\n>>> output = src.new_empty(output_shape).fill_(1)\r\n>>> output.scatter_reduce_(dim, index, src, reduce)\r\n`tensor([[ 0., 1., 1., 1.],\r\n        [ 1., 6., 1., 1.],\r\n        [20., 1., 1., 1.]])`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## torch.nn\r\n\r\n### `nn.GroupNorm`: Report an error if `num_channels` is not divisible by `num_groups` ([#74293](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/74293))\r\n\r\nPreviously, `nn.GroupNorm` would error out during the forward pass if `num_channels` is not divisible by `num_groups`. Now, the error is thrown for this case during module construction instead.\r\n\r\n1.11\r\n\r\n```python\r\nm = torch.nn.GroupNorm(3, 7)\r\nm(...)  # errors during forward pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.12\r\n\r\n```python\r\nm = torch.nn.GroupNorm(3, 7)  # errors during construction\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `nn.Dropout2d`: Return to 1.10 behavior: perform 1D channel-wise dropout for 3D inputs\r\n\r\nIn PyTorch 1.10 and older, passing a 3D input to `nn.Dropout2D` resulted in 1D channel-wise dropout behavior; i.e. such inputs were interpreted as having shape `(N, C, L)` with N = batch size and C = # channels and channel-wise dropout was performed along the second dimension.\r\n\r\n1.10\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\r\nm = nn.Dropout2d(p=0.5)\r\nout = m(x)  # input is assumed to be shape (N, C, L); dropout along the second dim.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of no-batch-dim input support in 1.11, 3D inputs were reinterpreted as having shape `(C, H, W)`; i.e. an input without a batch dimension, and dropout behavior was changed to drop along the first dimension. This was a silent breaking change.\r\n\r\n1.11\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\r\nm = nn.Dropout2d(p=0.5)\r\nout = m(x)  # input is assumed to be shape (C, H, W); dropout along the first dim.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe breaking change in 1.11 resulted in a lack of support for 1D channel-wise dropout behavior, so `Dropout2d`  in PyTorch 1.12 returns to 1.10 behavior with a warning to give some time to adapt before the no-batch-dim interpretation goes back into effect.\r\n\r\n1.12\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = torch.randn(2, 3, 4)\r\nm = nn.Dropout2d(p=0.5)\r\nout = m(x)  # input is assumed to be shape (N, C, L); dropout along the second dim.\r\n            # throws a warning suggesting nn.Dropout1d for 1D channel-wise dropout.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want 1D channel-wise dropout behavior, please switch to use of the newly-added `nn.Dropout1d` module instead of `nn.Dropout2d`. If you want no-batch-dim input behavior, please note that while this is not supported in 1.12, a future release will reinstate the interpretation of 3D inputs to `nn.Dropout2d` as those without a batch dimension.\r\n\r\n### **`F.cosine_similarity`: Improve numerical stability ([#31378](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/31378))**\r\n\r\nPreviously, we first compute the inner product, then normalize. After this change, we first normalize, then compute inner product. This should be more numerically stable because it avoids losing precision in inner product for inputs with large norms. Because of this change, outputs may be different in some cases.\r\n\r\n## Composability\r\n\r\n**Functions in torch.ops.aten.{foo} no longer accept `self` as a kwarg**\r\n\r\n`torch.ops.aten.{foo}` objects are now instances of `OpOverloadPacket` (instead of a function) that have their `__call__` method in Python, which means that you cannot pass `self` as a kwarg. You can pass it normally as a positional argument instead.\r\n\r\n1.11\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.ops.aten.sin(self=torch.ones(2))\r\n    tensor([0.8415, 0.8415])\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.12\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# this now fails\r\n>>> torch.ops.aten.sin(self=torch.ones(2))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: __call__() got multiple values for argument 'self'\r\n# this works\r\n>>> torch.ops.aten.sin(torch.ones(2))\r\ntensor([0.8415, 0.8415])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**__torch_dispatch__ now traces individual op overloads instead of op overload packets (**[**#72673**](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/72673)**)**\r\n\r\n`torch.ops.aten.add` actually corresponds to a bundle of functions from C++, corresponding to all over the overloads of add operator (specifically, `add.Tensor`, `add.Scalar` and `add.out`). Now, `__torch_dispatch__` will directly take in an overload corresponding to a single aten function.\r\n\r\n1.11\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyTensor(torch.Tensor):\r\n    ....\r\n    def __torch_dispatch__(cls, func, types, args=(), kwargs=None):\r\n        # Before, func refers to a \"packet\" of all overloads\r\n        # for a given operator, e.g. \"add\"\r\n        assert func == torch.ops.aten.add\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.12\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyTensor(torch.Tensor):\r\n    ....\r\n    def __torch_dispatch__(cls, func, types, args=(), kwargs=None):\r\n        # After, func refers to an individual operator overload,\r\n        # e.g. \"add.Tensor\"\r\n        assert func == torch.ops.aten.add.Tensor\r\n        # you can recover the old behavior with func.overloadpacket\r\n        assert func.overloadpacket == torch.ops.aten.add\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Profiler\r\n\r\n### Disable forward-backward correlation ([#72904](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/72904))\r\n\r\nThe forward-backward correlation is no longer captured as to workaround a profile crash. This feature may be reenabled in a future release after the underlying issue is fixed.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith torch.profiler.profile() as p:\r\n    loss = model(inputs)\r\n    loss.backward()  # Invoke autograd\r\n\r\n# The exported chrome trace will not have forward-backward flow events.

We no longer support version 3 bytecode models because the bytecode version was bumped from 3 to 4 more than half a year ago, and there was code in operator loading that performed differently on one operator on the global bytecode version 3. \r\n\r\nIf the model is generated before Oct 5, 2020, please use the following lines to update the model to the latest version:\r\n\r\n1.12\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch.jit.mobile import _get_model_bytecode_version\r\n\r\nold_model_path = \"old_model.ptl\"\r\nnew_model_path = \"new_model.ptl\"\r\n\r\n# Load full jit model\r\njit_model = torch.jit.load(old_model_path)\r\n# Save model for mobile \r\njit_model._save_for_lite_interpreter(new_model_path)\r\n# Verify the model can be loaded\r\nmobile_m = _load_for_lite_interpreter(new_model_path)\r\n\r\n# Get bytecode version from the new model\r\nbytecode_version = _get_model_bytecode_version(new_model_path)\r\nprint(f\"bytecode version is {bytecode_version}\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remove redundant FSDP prefix and change default auto wrap policy name to avoid confusion ([#76858](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/76858), [#73791](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/73791))\r\n\r\n`FullyShardedDataParallel`'s optional param name \u2018fsdp_auto_wrap_policy\u2019 (1.11) changed to \u2018auto_wrap_policy\u2019 (1.12). \u2018default_auto_wrap_policy\u2019 (1.11) is changed to \u2018size_based_auto_wrap_policy\u2019 (1.12). \r\n\r\nIn 1.11, when wrapping a model with FSDP instead of:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel = MyModel()\r\nwrapped_model = FullyShardedDataParallel(\r\n    model,\r\n    **fsdp_auto_wrap_policy**=functools.partial(\r\n        default_auto_wrap_policy,\r\n        min_num_params=0,  # wrap all modules\r\n    )\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.12\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel = MyModel()\r\nwrapped_model = FullyShardedDataParallel(\r\n    model,\r\n   **auto_wrap_policy**=functools.partial(\r\n        size_based_auto_wrap_policy,\r\n        min_num_params=0,  # wrap all modules\r\n    )\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n### TorchScript models exported prior to PyTorch 1.6 using quantized Linear, GRU and LSTM operators will no longer work ([#72680](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/72680), [#72522](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/72522)) \r\n\r\nTorchScript models created with PyTorch 1.5 or earlier and using the operators `quantized::linear_prepack_legacy`, `linear_prepack_fp16_legacy`, `quantized::linear_unpack.legacy`, or `quantized::linear_unpack_fp16.legacy` will no longer work and need to be re-exported.

This release is composed of over 3,300 commits since 1.10, made by 434 contributors. Along with 1.11, we are releasing beta versions of TorchData and functorch. We want to sincerely thank our community for continuously improving PyTorch.\r\n\r\n\r\n* TorchData is a new library for common modular data loading primitives for easily constructing flexible and performant data pipelines. [_View it on GitHub_](https://github.com/pytorch/data). \r\n* functorch, a library that adds composable function transforms to PyTorch, is now available in beta. [_View it on GitHub_](https://github.com/pytorch/functorch).\r\n* Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) static graph optimizations available in stable.\r\n\r\nYou can check the blogpost that shows the new features [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.11-released/).\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n### Fixed python `deepcopy` to correctly copy all attributes on `Tensor` objects ([#65584](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65584))\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that the `deepcopy` operation on Tensor properly copies all the attributes (and not just the plain Tensor properties).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.10.2</th><th>1.11.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\na = torch.rand(2)\r\na.foo = 3\r\ntorch.save(a, \"bar\")\r\nb = torch.load(\"bar\")\r\nprint(b.foo)\r\n# Raise AttributeError: \"Tensor\" object has no attribute \"foo\"\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\na = torch.rand(2)\r\na.foo = 3\r\ntorch.save(a, \"bar\")\r\nb = torch.load(\"bar\")\r\nprint(b.foo)\r\n# 3\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### **`steps` argument is no longer optional in `torch.linspace` and `torch.logspace`**\r\n\r\nThis argument used to default to 100 in PyTorch 1.10.2, but was deprecated (previously you would see a deprecation warning if you didn\u2019t explicitly pass in `steps`). In PyTorch 1.11, it is not longer optional.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.10.2</th><th>1.11.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# Works, but raises a deprecation warning\r\n# Steps defaults to 100\r\na = torch.linspace(1, 10)\r\n# UserWarning: Not providing a value for linspace's steps is deprecated\r\n# and will throw a runtime error in a future release.\r\n# This warning will appear only once per process.\r\n# (Triggered internally at  ../aten/src/ATen/native/RangeFactories.cpp:19\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n# In 1.11, you must specify steps\r\na = torch.linspace(1, 10, steps=100)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Remove `torch.hub.import_module` function that was mistakenly public ([#67990](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/67990))\r\n\r\nThis function is not intended for public use.\r\nIf you have existing code that relies on it, you can find an equivalent function at `torch.hub._import_module`.\r\n\r\n## C++ API\r\n\r\n### **We\u2019ve cleaned up many of the headers in the C++ frontend to only include the subset of `aten` operators that they actually used ([#68247](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68247), [#68687](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68687), [#68688](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68688), [#68714](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68714), [#68689](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68689), [#68690](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68690), [#68697](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68697), [#68691](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68691), [#68692](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68692), [#68693](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/68693), [#69840](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/69840))**\r\n\r\nWhen you `#include` a header from the C++ frontend, you can no longer assume that every `aten` operators are transitively included. You can work around this by directly adding `#include <ATen/ATen.h>` in your file, which will maintain the old behavior of including every `aten` operators.\r\n\r\n###  **Custom implementation for `c10::List` and `c10::Dict` move constructors have been removed (**[**#69370**](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/69370)**)**\r\n\r\nThe semantics have changed from \"make the moved-from List/Dict empty\" to \"keep the moved-from List/Dict unchanged\"\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.10.2</th><th>1.11.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"cpp\">\r\nc10::List<string> list1({\"3\", \"4\"});\r\nc10::List<string> list2(std::move(list1));\r\nstd::cout << list1.size() // 0\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"cpp\">\r\nc10::List<string> list1({\"3\", \"4\"});\r\nc10::List<string> list2(std::move(list1)); // calls copy ctr\r\nstd::cout << list1.size() // 2\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## CUDA\r\n\r\n### **Removed `THCeilDiv` function and corresponding `THC/THCDeviceUtils.cuh` header ([#65472](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65472))**\r\n\r\nAs part of cleaning up `TH` from the codebase, the `THCeilDiv` function has been removed. Instead, please use `at::ceil_div`, and include the corresponding `ATen/ceil_div.h` header\r\n\r\n### **Removed `THCudaCheck` (**[**#66391**](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/66391)**)**\r\n\r\nYou can replace it with `C10_CUDA_CHECK`, which has been available since at least PyTorch 1.4, so just replacing is enough even if you support older versions\r\n\r\n### **Removed `THCudaMalloc()`, `THCudaFree()`,  `THCThrustAllocator.cuh` (**[**#65492**](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65492)**)**\r\n\r\nIf your extension is using `THCThrustAllocator.cuh`, please replace it with `ATen/cuda/ThrustAllocator.h` and corresponding APIs (see examples in this PR).\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes `THCudaMalloc/THCudaFree` calls. Please use `c10::cuda::CUDACachingAllocator::raw_alloc(size)/raw_delete(ptr)`, or, preferably, switch to `c10:cuda::CUDaCachingAllocator::allocate` which manages deallocation. Caching allocator APIs are available since PyTorch 1.2, so just replacing it is enough even if you support older versions of PyTorch.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\n### Stopped building shared library for AOT Compiler, `libaot_compiler.so` ([#66227](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/66227))\r\n\r\nBuilding `aot_compiler.cpp` as a separate library is not necessary, as it\u2019s already included in `libtorch.so`.\r\nYou can update your build system to only dynamically link `libtorch.so`.\r\n\r\n## Mobile\r\n\r\n### Make `typing.Union` type unsupported for mobile builds ([#65556](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65556))\r\n\r\n`typing.Union` support was added for TorchScript in 1.10.

Previously we relied on `module.training` to decide which mode user wanted, but this was a misuse of the `training` attribute since that is not the intended purpose. This PR removes the dependency on `module.training` and uses separate APIs to make the fusion requested by the user explicit.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `fuse_module` used to support both cases and distinguished PTQ/QAT fusion based on `module.training`, but now `fuse_module` only supports the PTQ fusion. So, in the case when user wants to do QAT fusion, they need to change the call to `fuse_modules_qat`, instead of using `fuse_modules`, otherwise, they would silently get unwanted fusion results (PTQ fusion), or if the model is in training mode, it might result in error.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Currently it is still enforced that if the model is in eval mode, only PTQ fusion can be used; if the model is in training mode, then only QAT fusion can be used. In the future this constraint will be relaxed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.10.2</th><th>1.11.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch.ao.quantization import fuse_modules\r\nclass M(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 3, 3)\r\n        self.bn = torch.nn.BatchNorm2d(3)\r\n    def forward(self, x):\r\n        return self.bn(self.conv(x))\r\nm = M().train()\r\nm = fuse_modules(m, [\"conv\", \"bn\"])\r\nprint(type(m.conv))\r\nm = M().eval()\r\nm = fuse_modules(m, [\"conv\", \"bn\"])\r\nprint(type(m.conv))\r\n&lt;class 'torch.nn.intrinsic.modules.fused.ConvBn2d'&gt;\r\n&lt;class 'torch.nn.modules.conv.Conv2d'&gt;\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom torch.ao.quantization import fuse_modules\r\nclass M(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 3, 3)\r\n        self.bn = torch.nn.BatchNorm2d(3)\r\n    def forward(self, x):\r\n        return self.bn(self.conv(x))\r\nm = M().train()\r\n# For Quantization Aware Training, use fuse_modules_qat()\r\nm = fuse_modules_qat(m, [\"conv\", \"bn\"])\r\nprint(type(m.conv))\r\nm = M().eval()\r\nm = fuse_modules(m, [\"conv\", \"bn\"])\r\nprint(type(m.conv))\r\n# Result (doesn't change):\r\n&lt;class 'torch.nn.intrinsic.modules.fused.ConvBn2d'&gt;\r\n&lt;class 'torch.nn.modules.conv.Conv2d'&gt;\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n## ONNX\r\n\r\n### Removed `f` arg from `onnx.export_to_pretty_string` ([#69546](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/69546))\r\n\r\nThe arg has always been ignored.

This release is composed of over 3,400 commits since 1.9, made by 426 contributors. We want to sincerely thank our community for continuously improving PyTorch. \r\n\r\nPyTorch 1.10 updates are focused on improving training and performance of PyTorch, and developer usability. Highlights include:\r\n* CUDA Graphs APIs are integrated to reduce CPU overheads for CUDA workloads.\r\n* Several frontend APIs such as FX, `torch.special`, and `nn.Module` Parametrization, have moved from beta to stable.  \r\n* Support for automatic fusion in JIT Compiler expands to CPUs in addition to GPUs.\r\n* Android NNAPI support is now available in beta.\r\n\r\nYou can check the blogpost that shows the new features [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.10-released/).\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n### `torch.any`/`torch.all` behavior changed slightly to be more consistent for zero-dimension, `uint8` tensors. ([#64642](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/64642))\r\n\r\nThese two functions match the behavior of NumPy, returning an output dtype of bool for all support dtypes, except for `uint8` (in which case they return a 1 or a 0, but with `uint8` dtype). In some cases with 0-dim tensor inputs, the returned `uint8` value could mistakenly take on a value > 1. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> torch.all(torch.tensor(42, dtype=torch.uint8))\r\ntensor(1, dtype=torch.uint8)\r\n>>> torch.all(torch.tensor(42, dtype=torch.uint8), dim=0)\r\ntensor(42, dtype=torch.uint8) # wrong, old behavior\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> torch.all(torch.tensor(42, dtype=torch.uint8))\r\ntensor(1, dtype=torch.uint8)\r\n>>> torch.all(torch.tensor(42, dtype=torch.uint8), dim=0)\r\ntensor(1, dtype=torch.uint8) # new, corrected and consistent behavior\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `torch.{is,set}_deterministic` ([#62158](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/62158))\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the deprecation cycle for both of these functions. You should be using `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms` and`torch.are_deterministic_algorithms_enabled` instead.\r\n\r\n## Complex Numbers\r\n\r\n### **Conjugate View: [`tensor.conj()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.10./generated/torch.conj.html) now returns a view tensor that aliases the same memory and has conjugate bit set ([#54987](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/54987), [#60522](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/60522), [#66082](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/66082), [#63602](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/63602)).** \r\n\r\nThis means that `.conj()` is now an O(1) operation and returns a tensor that views the same memory as `tensor` and has conjugate bit set. This notion of conjugate bit enables fusion of operations with conjugation which gives a lot of performance benefit for operations like matrix multiplication. All out-of-place operations will have the same behavior as before, but an in-place operation on a conjugated tensor will additionally modify the input tensor. \r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> x = torch.tensor([1+2j])\r\n>>> y = x.conj()\r\n>>> y.add_(2)\r\n>>> print(x)\r\ntensor([1.+2.j])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> import torch\r\n>>> x = torch.tensor([1+2j])\r\n>>> y = x.conj()\r\n>>> y.add_(2)\r\n>>> print(x)\r\ntensor([3.+2.j])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nNote: You can verify if the conj bit is set by calling `tensor.is_conj()`. The conjugation can be resolved, i.e., you can obtain a new tensor that doesn\u2019t share storage with the input tensor at any time by calling `conjugated_tensor.clone()` or `conjugated_tensor.resolve_conj()` .\r\n\r\nNote that these conjugated tensors behave differently from the corresponding numpy arrays obtained from `np.conj()` when an in-place operation is performed on them (similar to the example shown above).\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Negative View: `tensor.conj().neg()` returns a view tensor that aliases the same memory as both tensor and `tensor.conj()` and has a negative bit set ([#56058](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/56058)).**\r\n\r\n`conjugated_tensor.neg()` continues to be an O(1) operation, but the returned tensor shares memory with both `tensor` and `conjugated_tensor`.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> x = torch.tensor([1+2j])\r\n>>> y = x.conj()\r\n>>> z = y.imag\r\n>>> z.add_(2)\r\n>>> print(x)\r\ntensor([1.+2.j])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> x = torch.tensor([1+2j])\r\n>>> y = x.conj()\r\n>>> z = y.imag\r\n>>> print(z.is_neg())\r\nTrue\r\n>>> z.add_(2)\r\n>>> print(x)\r\ntensor([1.-0.j])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### `tensor.numpy()` now throws `RuntimeError` when called on a tensor with conjugate or negative bit set ([#61925](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/61925)).\r\n\r\nBecause the notion of conjugate bit and negative bit doesn\u2019t exist outside of PyTorch, calling operations that return a Python object viewing the same memory as input like `.numpy()` would no longer work for tensors with conjugate or negative bit set.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> x = torch.tensor([1+2j])\r\n>>> y = x.conj().imag\r\n>>> print(y.numpy())\r\n[2.]\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> x = torch.tensor([1+2j])\r\n>>> y = x.conj().imag\r\n>>> print(y.numpy())\r\nRuntimeError: Can't call numpy() on Tensor that has negative\r\nbit set. Use tensor.resolve_neg().numpy() instead.\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Autograd\r\n\r\n### Raise `TypeError` instead of `RuntimeError` when assigning to a Tensor\u2019s grad field with wrong type ([#64876](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/64876))\r\n\r\nSetting the `.grad` field with a non-None and non-Tensor object used to return a `RuntimeError` but it now properly returns a `TypeError`. If your code was catching this error, you should simply update it to catch a `TypeError` instead of a `RuntimeError`.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ntry:\r\n    # Assigning an int to a Tensor's grad field\r\n    a.grad = 0\r\nexcept RuntimeError as e:\r\n    pass\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ntry:\r\n   a.grad = 0\r\nexcept TypeError as e:\r\n    pass\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Raise error when inputs to `autograd.grad` are empty ([#52016](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/52016))\r\n\r\nCalling `autograd.grad` with an empty list of inputs used to do the same as backward. To reduce confusion, it now raises the expected error. If you were relying on this, you can simply update your code as follows:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ngrad = autograd.grad(out, tuple())\r\nassert grad == tuple()\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nout.backward()\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Optional arguments to `autograd.gradcheck` and `autograd.gradgradcheck` are now kwarg-only ([#65290](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/65290))\r\n\r\nThese two functions now have a significant number of optional arguments controlling what they do (i.e., `eps`, `atol`, `rtol`, `raise_exception`, etc.). To improve readability, we made these arguments kwarg-only. If you are passing these arguments to `autograd.gradcheck` or `autograd.gradgradcheck` as positional arguments, you can update your code as follows:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ntorch.autograd.gradcheck(fn, x, 1e-6)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ntorch.autograd.gradcheck(fn, x, eps=1e-6)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### In-place detach (`detach_`) now errors for views that return multiple outputs ([#58285](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/58285))\r\n\r\nThis change is finishing the deprecation cycle for the inplace-over-view logic. In particular, a few things that were warning are updated:\r\n\r\n    * `detach_` will now raise an error when invoked on any view created by `split`, `split_with_sizes`, or `chunk`. You should use the non-inplace `detach` instead.\r\n    * The error message for when an in-place operation (that is not detach) is performed on a view created by `split`, `split_with_size`, and `chunk` has been changed from \"This view is an output of a function...\" to \"This view is the output of a function...\".\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nb = a.split(1)[0]\r\nb.detach_()\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nb = a.split(1)[0]\r\nc = b.detach()\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Fix saved variable unpacking version counter ([#60195](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/60195))\r\n\r\nIn-place on the unpacked SavedVariables used to be ignored. They are now properly detected which can lead to errors saying that a variable needed for backward was modified in-place.\r\nThis is a valid error and the user should fix this by cloning the unpacked saved variable before using it.\r\n\r\nNo internal formula will trigger this, but it might be triggered by user custom `autograd.Function` if the backward modifies a saved Tensor inplace and you do multiple backwards. This used to silently return the wrong result and will now raise the expected error.\r\n\r\n## torch.nn\r\n\r\n### Added optional tensor arguments to `__torch_function__` handling checks ([#63967](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/63967))\r\n\r\nThis fixes the `has_torch_function*()` checks throughout `torch.nn.functional` to correctly pass in optional tensor arguments; prior to this fix, `handle_torch_function()` was not called for these optional tensor arguments. Previously, passing a tensor-like object into a function that accepts an optional tensor might not trigger that object's `__torch_function__`. Now, the object's `__torch_function__` will be triggered as expected.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nimport torch\r\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\r\nclass TestTensor(object):\r\n    def __init__(self, weight):\r\n        self.weight = weight\r\n    def __torch_function__(self, func, _, args=(), kwargs=None):\r\n        print(func)\r\n        print(func == F.group_norm)\r\n# Call F.group_norm with a custom Tensor as the non-optional arg 'features'\r\nfeatures = TestTensor(torch.randn(3,3))\r\nF.group_norm(features, 3)\r\n# ...prints \"group_norm\" and True\r\n# Call F.group_norm with a custom Tensor as the optional arg 'weight'\r\nfeatures = torch.randn(3,3)\r\nweight = TestTensor(torch.randn(3))\r\nF.group_norm(features, 3, weight=weight)\r\n# ...prints \"group_norm\" and False because weight's __torch_function__ is\r\n# called with func as torch.group_norm instead of F.group_norm\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nimport torch\r\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\r\nclass TestTensor(object):\r\n    def __init__(self, weight):\r\n        self.weight = weight\r\n    def __torch_function__(self, func, _, args=(), kwargs=None):\r\n        print(func)\r\n        print(func == F.group_norm)\r\n# Call F.group_norm with a custom Tensor as the non-optional arg 'features'\r\nfeatures = TestTensor(torch.randn(3,3))\r\nF.group_norm(features, 3)\r\n# ...prints \"group_norm\" and True\r\n# Call F.group_norm with a custom Tensor as the optional arg 'weight'\r\nfeatures = torch.randn(3,3)\r\nweight = TestTensor(torch.randn(3))\r\nF.group_norm(features, 3, weight=weight)\r\n# ...prints \"group_norm\" and True\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## CUDA\r\n\r\n### Removed post-backward syncs on default stream ([#60421](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/60421))\r\n\r\nCalls to backward() or grad() synced only the calling thread's default stream with autograd leaf streams at the end of backward. This made the following weird pattern safe:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith torch.cuda.stream(s):\r\n    # imagine forward used many streams, so backward leaf nodes may run on many streams\r\n    loss.backward()# no sync\r\nuse grads\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut a more benign-looking pattern was unsafe:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith torch.cuda.stream(s):\r\n    # imagine forward used a lot of streams, so backward leaf nodes may run on many streams\r\n    loss.backward()\r\n    # backward() syncs the default stream with all the leaf streams, but does not sync s with anything,\r\n    # so counterintuitively (even though we're in the same stream context as backward()!)\r\n    # it is NOT SAFE to use grads here, and there's no easy way to make it safe,\r\n    # unless you manually sync on all the streams you used in forward,\r\n    # or move \"use grads\" back to default stream outside the context.\r\n    use grads\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: this change makes it so that backward() has [same user-facing stream semantics as any cuda op](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/cuda.html#stream-semantics-of-backward-passes).** In other words, the weird pattern is unsafe, and the benign-looking pattern is safe. Implementation-wise, this meant backward() should sync its calling thread's current stream, not default stream, with the leaf streams. This PR  deletes syncs on the default stream. \r\n\r\n## torch.package\r\n\r\n* Removed verbose mode from PackageExporter ([#61145](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/61145))\r\n    * PackageExporter is losing \u201cverbose\u201d mode argument as we have found it is not useful and sometimes confusing. See following examples on how to modify your code to accommodate this change.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nwith PackageExporter(buffer, verbose=False) as e:\r\n    e.intern(\"**\")\r\n    e.save_pickle(\"res\", \"mod1.pkl\", mod1)\r\n    e.save_pickle(\"res\", \"mod2.pkl\", mod2)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nwith PackageExporter(buffer) as e:\r\n    e.intern(\"**\")\r\n    e.save_pickle(\"res\", \"mod1.pkl\", mod1)\r\n    e.save_pickle(\"res\", \"mod2.pkl\", mod2)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n### Added extra observer/fake_quant (the same observer/fake_quant instance as the input) for some operators in prepare_fx, e.g. maxpool, add_scalar and mul_scalar ([#61687](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/61687), [#61859](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/61859))\r\n\r\nPreviously the way we insert observers/fake_quants are specific to fbgemm/qnnpack backend, as we work on making FX Graph Mode Quantization extensible to custom backends, we are changing some behaviors for the fbgemm/qnnpack path as well. The above changes are adding extra observer/fake_quant to the output of some operators to make sure we model the quantized operator more accurately in quantization aware training, the comprehensive list of operators where the behavior changes are the following:\r\n\r\n* modules: torch.nn.MaxPool1d, torch.nn.MaxPool2d, torch.nn.MaxPool3d, torch.nn.Identity\r\n* torch functions: torch.nn.functional.max_pool1d, torch.nn.functional.max_pool2d, torch.nn.functional.max_pool3d, torch.chunk, torch.flatten, torch.transpose, torch.repeat_interleave, torch.sort, torch.squeeze, torch.stack, torch.unsqueeze, operator.getitem, \r\n* Tensor methods: chunk, contiguous, detach, detach_, numel, permute, repeat, repeat_interleave, reshape, resize_, shape, size, squeeze, squeeze_, transpose, unsqueeze, unsqueeze_, view\r\n* Tensor operations: add scalar and mul scalar (add/mul with a Tensor and a Scalar input)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will show an example with torch.nn.MaxPool2d:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass M(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.maxpool2d = torch.nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=3)\r\n\r\n    def forward(self, x):\r\n        x = self.maxpool2d(x)\r\n        return x\r\nm = M().eval()        \r\nm = prepare_fx(m, {\"\": torch.quantization.default_qconfig})\r\nprint(m.code)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ndef forward(self, x):\r\n    x_activation_post_process_0 = self.x_activation_post_process_0(x); x = None\r\n    maxpool2d = self.maxpool2d(x_activation_post_process_0); x_activation_post_process_0 = None\r\n    return maxpool2d\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ndef forward(self, x):\r\n    x_activation_post_process_0 = self.x_activation_post_process_0(x); x = None\r\n    maxpool2d = self.maxpool2d(x_activation_post_process_0); x_activation_post_process_0 = None\r\n    maxpool2d_activation_post_process_0 = self.maxpool2d_activation_post_process_0(maxpool2d); maxpool2d = None\r\n    return maxpool2d_activation_post_process_0\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nNote that `self.maxpool2d_activation_post_process_0` and `self.x_activation_post_process_0` will refer to the same observer/fake_quant instance, this is to simulate the numerics for the quantized maxpool implementation, where the output would reuse the quantization parameter of the input. Simple illustration with graph:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobserver_0 - maxpool - ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobserver_0 - maxpool - observer_0 (same observer instance as input observer) - ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ONNX\r\n\r\n### Removed `aten` arg from `torch.onnx.export()`. ([#62759](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/62759))\r\n\r\nThe new `OperatorExportTypes.ONNX` removes the need for an explicit `aten` argument. If Pytorch was built with `-DPYTORCH_ONNX_CAFFE2_BUNDLE` the a `None` value means `OperatorExportTypes.ONNX_ATEN_FALLBACK`\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.9.1</th><th>1.10.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ntorch.onnx.export(..., aten=True)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\ntorch.onnx.export(..., operator_export_type=torch.onnx.OperatorExportTypes.ONNX_ATEN)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n### Deprecate **`__torch_function__`** as a plain methods ([#64843](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/64843))\r\n\r\nThe `__torch_function__` function used to create Tensor like objects did not have any constraint whether it should be a method, class method or static method.\r\n\r\nTo make it compatible with newer features on Tensor-like objects, we are deprecating setting it as a plain method. You can define it as a class method to get the current class and scan the argument list if you need an object that is an instance of this class.\r\n\r\n## Mobile\r\n\r\n### Removed API torch.utils.bundled_inputs.run_on_bundled_input ([#58344](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/58344))\r\n\r\nThis API caused many issues and is not really necessary. The functionality (run model with bundled input) can be achieved by using `get_all_bundled_inputs`. For example:\r\n\r\n1.9.1:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel.run_on_bundled_input(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.10.0:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmodel(*model.get_all_bundled_inputs()[0])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Distributed\r\n\r\n### `torch.distributed.rpc`: Removed ProcessGroup RPC backend ([#62411](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/62411) , [#62985](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/62985))\r\n\r\nProcessGroup RPC backend has been deprecated and 1.9 was the last release which carried it. The default RPC backend is TensorPipe which is the recommended backend for RPC.

The release is composed of more than 3,400 commits since 1.8, made by 398 contributors. Highlights include:\r\n\r\n* Major improvements to support scientific computing, including torch.linalg, torch.special, and Complex Autograd\r\n* Major improvements in on-device binary size with Mobile Interpreter\r\n* Native support for elastic-fault tolerance training through the upstreaming of TorchElastic into PyTorch Core\r\n* Major updates to the PyTorch RPC framework to support large scale distributed training with GPU support\r\n* New APIs to optimize performance and packaging for model inference deployment \r\n* Support for Distributed training, GPU utilization and SM efficiency in the PyTorch Profiler\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d like to thank the community for their support and work on this latest release. We\u2019d especially like to thank Quansight and Microsoft for their contributions.\r\n\r\nYou can find more details on all the highlighted features in the [_PyTorch 1.9 Release blogpost_](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.9-released/). \r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n* **`torch.divide` with `rounding_mode='floor'` now returns infinity when a non-zero number is divided by zero (**[**#56893**](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/56893)**).**\r\nThis fixes the `rounding_mode='floor'` behavior to return the same non-finite values as other rounding modes when there is a division by zero. Previously it would always result in a NaN value, but a non-zero number divided by zero should return +/- infinity in IEEE floating point arithmetic. Note this does not effect `torch.floor_divide` or the floor division operator, which currently use `rounding_mode='trunc'` (and are also deprecated for that reason).\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.8.1</th><th>1.9.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0])\r\n>>> b = torch.tensor([0.0])\r\n>>> torch.divide(a, b, rounding_mode='floor')\r\ntensor([nan, nan, nan])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([-1.0, 0.0, 1.0])\r\n>>> b = torch.tensor([0.0])\r\n>>> torch.divide(a, b, rounding_mode='floor')\r\ntensor([-inf, nan, inf])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n        \r\n\r\n* **Legacy tensor constructors and `Tensor.new` no longer support passing both `Tensor` and `device` as inputs  ([#58108](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/58108)).**\r\nThis fixes a bug in which 1-element integer tensors were misinterpreted as specifying tensor size, yielding an uninitialized tensor. As noted in the error message, use the new-style `torch.tensor(...)` or `torch.as_tensor(...)` to copy or alias an existing tensor. If you want to create an uninitialized tensor, use `torch.empty(...)`. \r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.8.1</th><th>1.9.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([1])\r\n>>> torch.LongTensor(a, device='cpu') # uninitialized\r\ntensor([7022349217739848992])\r\n>>> a.new(a, device='cpu')\r\ntensor([4294967295]) # uninitialized\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> a = torch.tensor([1])\r\n>>> torch.LongTensor(a, device='cpu')\r\nRuntimeError: Legacy tensor constructor of the form torch.Tensor(tensor, device=device) is\r\nnot supported.

Note that `gradcheck` itself still supports functions with complex output. This new restriction only applies to calls to the two internal helper functions. As a workaround, you can wrap your functions to return either the real or imaginary component of its output before calling these functions. Additionally these internal helpers no longer accept any other value except 1 for `grad_out` for any input function. Note that these helper functions are also being deprecated in this release.\r\n \r\n1.8.1:\r\n```python\r\nget_numerical_jacobian(torch.complex, (a, b), grad_out=2.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.9.0:\r\n```python\r\n      def wrapped(fn):\r\n            def wrapper(*input):\r\n                return torch.real(fn(*input))\r\n            return wrapper\r\n        \r\n        get_numerical_jacobian(wrapped(torch.complex), (a, b), grad_out=1.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **`torch.autograd.gradcheck` now throws `GradcheckError`** ([#55656](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55656)).\r\nThis change is a part of a refactor of `gradcheck`\u2019s internals. All errors that are able to be silenced by `raise_exception=False` now raise `GradcheckError` (which inherits from `RuntimeError`). If you explicitly check that the type of the error is `RuntimeError` you'll need to update your code to check for `GradcheckError` instead. Otherwise if you use something like `except` or `isinstance`, no changes are necessary.\r\n\r\n1.8.1:\r\n```python\r\n# An example of a situation that will now return GradcheckError instead of\r\n# RuntimeError is when there is a jacobian mismatch, which can happen\r\n# for example when you forget to specify float64 for your inputs.\r\ntry:\r\n    torch.autograd.gradcheck(torch.sin, (torch.ones(1, requires_grad=True),))\r\nexcept RuntimeError as e:\r\n    assert type(e) is RuntimeError # explicitly check type -> NEEDS UPDATE\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.9.0:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    torch.autograd.gradcheck(torch.sin, (torch.ones(1, requires_grad=True),)\r\nexcept RuntimeError as e:\r\n   # GradcheckError inherits from RuntimeError so you can still catch this\r\n   # with RuntimeError (No change necessary!)\r\n   \r\n   # BUT, if you explicitly check type...\r\n   assert type(e) is torch.autograd.GradcheckError\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Finished deprecation cycle for in-place view error checks** ([#56093](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/56093)).\r\n In-place modification of views will now raise an error if that view was created by a custom function or a function that returns multiple views, or if the view was created in no-grad mode. Modifying in-place a view created in the situations above are error-prone and have been deprecated since v1.5.0. Doing these in-place modifications are now forbidden. For more information on how to work around this, see the related sections the release notes linked below:\r\n    * [v1.5.0](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases?after=v1.5.1) (view created in custom autograd function, view created in no-grad block)\r\n    * [v1.7.0](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases?after=v1.8.0-rc3) (section on `split` and `chunk`, i.e., functions that return multiple views).\r\n\r\n## torch.nn\r\n\r\n* **Fixed regression for `nn.MultiheadAttention` to now apply bias flag to both in and out projection layers** ([#52537](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/52537)).\r\nIn PyTorch 1.6, a regression was introduced that caused the `bias` flag of `nn.MultiheadAttention` only to apply to the input projection layer. This caused the output projection layer to always include a `bias` parameter, even with `bias=False` specified. The regression is now fixed in PyTorch 1.9, making the `bias` flag correctly apply to both the input and output projection layers. This fix is BC-breaking for the `bias=False` case as it will now result in no `bias` parameter for the output projection layer.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>v1.6 - v1.8.1:</th><th>pre 1.6 & 1.9.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> mha = torch.nn.MultiheadAttention(4, 2, bias=False)\r\n>>> print(mha.out_proj.bias)\r\nParameter containing:\r\ntensor([0., 0., 0., 0.], requires_grad=True)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> mha = torch.nn.MultiheadAttention(4, 2, bias=False)\r\n>>> print(mha.out_proj.bias)\r\nNone\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Updated `nn.Module` to fire full backward hooks even when no input requires grad** ([#56693](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/56693)).\r\nPrior to this release, full backward hooks were not fired when no input requires gradients. This has been changed so that full backward hooks will always fire during the backward pass, regardless of whether or not any input requires gradients.

By adding this attribute, we are able to extend `IterableDataset` to have type inference and lazy initialization to incorporate the new DataLoader architecture. But, several BC-breaking restrictions are introduced due to this feature.\r\n\r\n1.8.1:\r\n```python\r\n# Users can use string to bypass the invalid type annotation without any error. \r\n# And, incorrect type annotations attached to `__iter__` function are ignored.\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.9.0:\r\n```python\r\n# The following scenario will now raise different Exceptions\r\n# 1) The type annotation is required to be valid now. Previous workaround\r\n# like using string to  represent the invalid type annotation is not supported now.\r\n\r\n# Raises Exception from the evaluation `eval(\"invalid_type\", globals, locals)`\r\nclass DS(IterableDataset[\"invalid_type\"]):  \r\n     ...\r\n# Raises TypeError if the return type of __iter__ is not an Iterator\r\nclass DS(IterableDataset[str]):\r\n    def __iter__(self) -> str:\r\n      ...\r\n# Raise TypeError if the return type of __iter__ is of the form Iterator[X], \r\n# but the argument type X is not a subtype of the IterableDataset.type attribute.\r\nclass DS(IterableDataset[str]):\r\n    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]:\r\n       ...\r\n\r\n#  IterableDatset now has a metaclass, which will conflict with\r\n#  existing user-defined metaclasses on IterableDatasets\r\nclass DS(IterableDataset[str], metaclass=MyMeta): \r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Meta API\r\n\r\n* **Given Tensor a non-trivial (for now) metaclass _TensorMeta** ([#56147](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/56147)).\r\nTensor now has a non-trivial metaclass. This shouldn't be user observable, as Tensor already inherits from a C defined class (and is thus incompatible with other typical metaclasses), but there may be unanticipated interactions with other language features in Python. This PR changes the metaclass of torch.tensor. I.e. `type(type(torch.tensor([1])))` now prints `<class 'torch._C._TensorMeta'>` (used to be `<class 'type'>`)\r\n\r\n## C++ API\r\n\r\n* **Changed in-place resize functions to return const Tensor&** ([#55351](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55351)).\r\nThe C++ signature for `resize_`, `resize_as_`, `resize_as_sparse_`, `sparse_resize_`, and `sparse_resize_and_clear_` has changed to return a `const Tensor&` instead of a `Tensor&`. This may break users\u2019 TORCH_LIBRARY operators that called these functions but returned a non-const `Tensor&`. Ideally, users can change their operators to also consume and return `const Tensor&`, but simply casting the result of the changed function with `const_cast<Tensor&>` is also an option.\r\n\r\n1.8.1:\r\n```cpp\r\nconst at::Tensor a = at::randn({2, 2});\r\nconst at::Tensor b = at::ones({1, 4}, at::kInt);\r\nat::Tensor& out = at::resize_as_(a, b); # success\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.9.0:\r\n```cpp\r\nconst at::Tensor b = at::ones({1, 4}, at::kInt);\r\nat::Tensor& out = at::resize_as_(a, b); \r\n# error: binding value of type 'const at::Tensor' to reference to type 'at::Tensor' drops 'const' qualifier\r\nconst at::Tensor& out = at::resize_as_(a, b); # Success\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Some ATen Reduction Ops as well as `kron_out` now throw an error when an undefined tensor is passed as input for `out` argument** ([#53218](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/53218), [#53640](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/53640)).\r\n    * C++ API for the reductions ops like `sum_out`, `nansum_out`, `prod_out`, `std_var_out` have been changed to require users allocating result Tensor before calling these ops. The C++ API `allocate_reduction_result` has changed to `resize_reduction_result` to disallow allocating result Tensor in these reduction ops.\r\n    * The following code can be compiled, but will raise a `c10::Error` when executed. This code compiled and executed successfully in the prior release.\r\n```cpp\r\nat::Tensor out;  # Undefined Tensor\r\nconst at::Tensor a = at::randn({2, 2});\r\nat::IntArrayRef dim = {1};\r\nat::sum_out(out, a, dim);\r\n# c10::Error: Expected a Tensor of type Variable but found an undefined Tensor for argument #4 'out'\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **The C++ API utility functions `expand_inplace` and `expand_outplace` now return `c10::MaybeOwned<Tensor>` instead of `std::tuple<Tensor>`** ([#55065](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55065), [#55245](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55245)). \r\nThe rationale for this change is to avoid unnecessary Tensor creation, thus improving performance. Functions in ExpandUtils return `c10::MaybeOwned<Tensor>` because expansion may not actually be needed, in which case we can improve efficiency by returning `c10::MaybeOwned<Tensor>::borrowed(to_expand)`. However, this means that you need to be careful: the returned `c10::MaybeOwned<Tensor> `must not outlive the original `Tensor` object that `to_expand` referred to! The deleted rvalue reference overloads of these functions help with this by preventing trivial use of a temporary resulting from a function call, but it is still possible to make a mistake. \r\n\r\n## TorchScript\r\n\r\n* **Added recursive scripting for class type module attributes** ([#55124](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55124)).\r\n    * This change is BC-breaking because it will result in class type module attributes being scripted when a module instance is scripted. In previous versions, such attributes were ignored unless their class type was also marked with `@torch.jit.script`. This new feature attempts to script the type, and falls back to the old behaviour of marking the class type attribute as \"failed\" if scripting fails. However, if the class definition does not have type annotations, the definition of the scripted class can different from users might expect (see code sample). If needed, users can explicitly disable the scripting of a class type attribute by adding its name to the `__jit_ignored_attributes__` class attribute of the module being scripted.\r\n\r\n1.8.1:\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def __init__(self, a):\r\n        self.attr = a\r\n        \r\nclass MyModule(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.attr = MyClass(4)\r\n        \r\nsm = torch.jit.script(MyModule())\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.9.0:\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def __init__(self, a):\r\n        self.attr = a\r\n        \r\nclass MyModule(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.attr = MyClass(4)\r\n \r\n# RuntimeError: Could not cast attribute 'attr' to type Tensor: Unable to cast Python instance of type <class 'int'> to C++ type 'at::Tensor'         \r\nsm = torch.jit.script(MyModule()) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error occurs because `MyClass` is automatically scripted, but `self.attr` is inferred to be a `Tensor` instead of an `int` because `a` is not annotated. To fix this, annotate `a` with the right type `int`, or mark `attr` as an attribute that should be ignored by the scripting process and not recursively processed:\r\n```python\r\n       class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):\r\n            __jit_ignored_attributes__ = [\"attr\"]\r\n        \r\n            def __init__(self):\r\n                self.attr = MyClass(4)\r\n```\r\n                \r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n*  **`torch.quantization.quantize_fx.convert_fx`\u2019s `debug` argument has been changed to `is_reference` ([#52179](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/52179)).**\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.8.1:</th><th>1.9.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\nimport torch.quantization.quantize_fx as quantize_fx\r\n>>> m = quantize_fx.convert_fx(m, debug=True)\r\n(Runs successfully)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> m = quantize_fx.convert_fx(m, is_reference=True) # Runs successfully\r\n>>> m = quantize_fx.convert_fx(m, debug=True)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: convert_fx() got an unexpected keyword argument 'debug'\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* **`torch.cat` is now quantized to `torch.cat` instead of `torch.ops.quantized.cat` ([#54924](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/54924)).**\r\nPreviously, we produced torch.ops.quantize.cat which took inputs, dequantized them\r\n        and requantized them with new qparams. This behavior has been changed to produce `torch.cat` directly. [torch.cat](http://torch.cat/) uses the same observer/fake_quant instance for all inputs and output, assumes all inputs are sharing the same qparam, and produces a quantized Tensor with\r\n        the same qparam as all inputs. Using torch.cat is expected to be more efficient since it does not introduce extra quant/dequant.\r\n    * Version 1.8.1: `torch.cat` was quantized to  `torch.ops.quantized.cat.`\r\n    * Version 1.9: `torch.cat` is quantized to `torch.cat` (`torch.cat` works on both floating point and quantized Tensor).\r\n\r\n## Distributed\r\n\r\n* **`DistributedDataParallel`: Removed support for inter-process device replication in DDP ([#54454](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/54454),  [#54825](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/54825), [#54826](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/54826), [#55212](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55212), [#55253](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55253)`, `[`#55353`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/55353)).**\r\n`DistributedDataParallel` now errors out when users attempt to use it in single-process multi-device mode, where a module is replicated across more than one device in a single process. This mode had been previously deprecated and is now removed.

This release is composed of more than 3,000 commits since 1.7. It includes major updates and new features for compilation, code optimization, frontend APIs for scientific computing, and AMD ROCm support through binaries that are available via pytorch.org. It also provides improved features for large-scale training for pipeline and model parallelism, and gradient compression. A few of the highlights include:\r\n\r\n1. Support for doing python to python functional transformations via `torch.fx`;\r\n2. Added or stabilized APIs to support FFTs (`torch.fft`), Linear Algebra functions (`torch.linalg`), added support for autograd for complex tensors and updates to improve performance for calculating hessians and jacobians; and\r\n3. Significant updates and improvements to distributed training including: Improved NCCL reliability; Pipeline parallelism support; RPC profiling; and support for communication hooks adding gradient compression. See the full release notes [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases).\r\n\r\nAlong with 1.8, we are also releasing major updates to PyTorch libraries including [TorchCSPRNG](https://github.com/pytorch/csprng), [TorchVision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision), [TorchText](https://github.com/pytorch/text) and [TorchAudio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio). For more on the library releases, see the post [here](http://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.8-new-library-releases). As previously noted, features in PyTorch releases are classified as Stable, Beta and Prototype. You can learn more about the definitions in the post [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.8-new-library-releases).\r\n\r\nYou can find more details on all the highlighted features in the [PyTorch 1.8 Release blogpost](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.8-released/).\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n### Fix Tensor inplace modulo in python ([#49390](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/49390))\r\n\r\nInplace modulo in python `%=` was wrongfully done out of place for Tensors. This change fixes the behavior.\r\nPrevious code that was relying on this operation being done out of place should be updated to use the out of place version `t = t % other` instead of `t %= other`.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.7.1</th><th>1.8.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> a = torch.arange(0, 10)\r\n>>> b = a\r\n>>> b %= 3\r\n>>> print(a)\r\ntensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\r\n>>> print(b)\r\ntensor([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> a = torch.arange(0, 10)\r\n>>> b = a\r\n>>> b %= 3\r\n>>> print(a)\r\ntensor([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0])\r\n>>> print(b)\r\ntensor([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Standardize `torch.clamp` edge cases ([#43288](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43288))\r\n\r\nFor ease of exposition let `a_min` be the value of the \"min\" argument to clamp, and `a_max` be the value of the \"max\" argument to clamp.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of torch.clamp to always compute `min(max(a, a_min), a_max)`. `torch.clamp` currently computes this in its vectorized CPU implementation but uses different approaches for other backends.\r\nThese implementations are the same when `a_min < a_max`, but divergent when `a_min > a_max`. This divergence is easily triggered:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> t = torch.arange(200).to(torch.float)\r\n>>> torch.clamp(t, 4, 2)[0]\r\ntensor(2.)\r\n\r\n>>> torch.clamp(t.cuda(), 4, 2)[0]\r\ntensor(4., device='cuda:0')\r\n\r\n>>> torch.clamp(torch.tensor(0), 4, 2)\r\ntensor(4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the behavior consistent with NumPy's `clip`. C++'s `std::clamp`'s behavior is undefined when `a_min > a_max`. Python has no standard clamp implementation.\r\n\r\n### Tensor deepcopy now properly copies the `.grad` field ([#50663](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50663))\r\n\r\nThe deepcopy protocol will now properly copy the `.grad` field of Tensors when it exists.\r\nThe old behavior can be recovered by setting the `.grad` field to `None` after doing the deepcopy.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.7.1</th><th>1.8.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.grad\r\ntensor([0.8883, 0.5765])\r\n>>> deepcopy(t).grad\r\nNone\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.grad\r\ntensor([0.8883, 0.5765])\r\n>>> deepcopy(t).grad\r\ntensor([0.8883, 0.5765])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fix `torch.fmod` type promotion ([#47323](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/47323), [#48278](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48278))\r\n\r\n1.7.1\r\nRaises RuntimeError for integral tensor and floating-point tensor.\r\nThe dtype of output is determined by the first input.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> x = torch.arange(start=1, end=6, dtype=torch.int32) # tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\r\n>>> y = torch.arange(start=1.1, end=2.1, step=0.2, dtype=torch.float32) # tensor([1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9])\r\n>>> torch.fmod(x, y)\r\nRuntimeError: result type Float can't be cast to the desired output type Int\r\n>>> z = torch.arange(start=0.2, end=1.1, step=0.2, dtype=torch.float64) # tensor([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.], dtype=torch.float64)\r\n>>> torch.fmod(y, z).dtype\r\ntorch.float32\r\n>>> torch.fmod(z, y).dtype\r\ntorch.float64\r\n>>> torch.fmod(x, 1.2)\r\ntensor([0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=torch.int32)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n1.8.0:\r\nSupport integral tensor and floating-point tensor as inputs.\r\nThe dtype of output is determined by both inputs.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> x = torch.arange(start=1, end=6, dtype=torch.int32) # tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\r\n>>> y = torch.arange(start=1.1, end=2.1, step=0.2, dtype=torch.float32) # tensor([1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9])\r\n>>> torch.fmod(x, y)\r\ntensor([1.0000, 0.7000, 0.0000, 0.6000, 1.2000])\r\n>>> z = torch.arange(start=0.2, end=1.1, step=0.2, dtype=torch.float64) # tensor([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.], dtype=torch.float64)\r\n>>> torch.fmod(y, z).dtype\r\ntorch.float64\r\n>>> torch.fmod(z, y).dtype\r\ntorch.float64\r\n>>> torch.fmod(x, 1.2)\r\ntensor([1.0000, 0.8000, 0.6000, 0.4000, 0.2000])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Preserve non-dense or overlapping tensor's layout in *_like functions ([#46046](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/46046))\r\n\r\nAll the `*_like` factory functions will now generate the same striding as out of place operations would.\r\nThis means in particular that non-contiguous tensors will produce non-contiguous outputs.\r\nIf you require a contiguous output, you can pass the `memory_format=torch.contiguous` keyword argument to the factory function. Such factory functions include `clone`, `to`, `float`, `cuda,` `*_like`, `zeros`, `rand{n}`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Make output of `torch.norm` and `torch.linalg.norm` consistent for complex inputs ([#48284](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48284))\r\n\r\nPreviously, when given a complex input, `torch.linalg.norm` and `torch.norm` would return a complex output. `torch.linalg.cond` would sometimes return a complex output and sometimes return a real output when given a complex input, depending on its `p` argument. This PR changes this behavior to match `numpy.linalg.norm` and `numpy.linalg.cond`, so that a complex input will result in a real number type, consistent with NumPy.\r\n\r\n### Make `torch.svd` return `V`, not `V.conj()` for complex inputs ([#51012](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/51012))\r\n\r\n`torch.svd` added support for complex inputs in PyTorch 1.7, but was not documented as doing so. The complex `V` tensor returned was actually the complex conjugate of what's expected. This PR fixes the discrepancy.\r\nUsers that were already using the previous version of `torch.svd` with complex inputs can recover the previous behavior by taking the complex conjugate of the returned `V`.\r\n\r\n### `torch.angle`: properly handle pure real numbers ([#49163](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/49163))\r\n\r\nThis PR updates PyTorch's `torch.angle` operator to be consistent with NumPy's. Previously `torch.angle` would return zero for all real inputs (including NaN). Now angle returns `pi` for negative real inputs, zero for non-negative real inputs, and propagates NaNs.\r\n\r\n### Enable distribution validation by default for `torch.distributions` ([#48743](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48743))\r\n\r\nThis may slightly slow down some models. Concerned users may disable validation by using `torch.distributions.Distribution.set_default_validate_args(False)` or by disabling individual distribution validation via `MyDistribution(..., validate_args=False)`.\r\n\r\nThis may cause new `ValueErrors` in models that rely on unsupported behavior, e.g. `Categorical.log_prob()` applied to continuous-valued tensors (only {0,1}-valued tensors are supported).\r\nSuch models should be fixed but the previous behavior can be recovered by disabling argument validation using the methods mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Prohibit assignment to a sparse tensor ([#50040](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/50040))\r\n\r\nAssigning to a sparse Tensor did not work properly and resulted in a no-op. The following code now properly raises an error:\r\n```python\r\n>>> t = torch.rand(10).to_sparse()\r\n>>> t[0] = 42\r\nTypeError: Cannot assign to a sparse tensor\r\n```\r\n\r\n### C++ API: operators that take a list of optional `Tensor`s cannot be called with `ArrayRef<Tensor>` anymore ([#49138](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/49138))\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the C++ API representation of lists of optional Tensors (e.g. in the `Tensor::``index` method) from `ArrayRef<Tensor>` to  `List<optional<Tensor>>`. This change breaks backwards compatibility, since there is no implicit conversion from `ArrayRef<Tensor>` to `List<optional<Tensor>>`. \r\n\r\nA common call pattern is `tensor.index({indices_tensor})`, where `indices_tensor` is a `Tensor`. This will continue to work because the `{}` initializer_list constructor for `List<optional<Tensor>>` can take `Tensor` elements that are implicitly converted to `optional<Tensor>`. \r\n\r\nHowever, another common call pattern is `tensor.index(indices_tensor)`, where previously the `Tensor` got implicitly converted to an `ArrayRef<Tensor>`. To implicitly convert `Tensor` -> `optional<Tensor>` -> `List<optional<Tensor>>` would chain two implicit conversions, which C++ doesn't allow. So those call sites should be rewritten to use the  `tensor.index({indices_tensor})` pattern.\r\n\r\n### Autograd view creation informations are now properly propagated when views are chained\r\n\r\nAfter this fix, an error will properly be thrown to avoid wrong gradients when an in-place operation is performed on a view of a view, when in-place operation were not allowed on the first view.\r\nThis means that code that used to return wrong gradients in 1.7.1 (such as `t.unbind()[0].select(0, 0).add_(1)`) will now properly raise an error.\r\n\r\n### End of deprecation cycle for spectral ops in the torch. namespace ([#48594](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48594))\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the deprecated `torch.{fft,rfft,ifft,irfft}` and their corresponding methods on `torch.Tensor`. PyTorch programs using these functions must now update to use the `torch.fft` namespace.\r\n\r\n### `torch.digamma` : properly handle all inputs ([#48302](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48302))\r\n\r\nThis PR updates PyTorch's `torch.digamma` function to be consistent with SciPy's `special.digamma` function. This changes the result of the `torch.digamma` function on the nonpositive integers, where the gamma function is not defined. Since the gamma function is undefined at these points, the (typical) derivative of the logarithm of the gamma function is also undefined at these points, and for negative integers this PR updates `torch.digamma` to return `NaN`. For zero, however, it returns `-inf` to be consistent with SciPy.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, SciPy made a similar change, which was noticed by at least one user: [scipy/scipy#9663](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9663#issue-396587679)\r\n\r\nSciPy's returning of negative infinity at zero is intentional:\r\nhttps://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/59347ae8b86bcc92c339efe213128f64ab6df98c/scipy/special/cephes/psi.c#L163\r\n\r\nThis change is consistent with the C++ standard for the gamma function:\r\nhttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/tgamma\r\n\r\n### Fix `torch.remainder` type promotion ([#48668](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48668))\r\n\r\n1.7.1:\r\nIn the case where the second argument is a python number, the result is casted to the dtype of the first argument.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.remainder(x, 1.2)\r\ntensor([0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=torch.int32)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n1.8.0\r\nIn the case where the second argument is a python number, the dtype of result is determined by type promotion of both inputs.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> torch.remainder(x, 1.2)\r\ntensor([1.0000, 0.8000, 0.6000, 0.4000, 0.2000])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes to onnx export API to better handle named arguments ([#47367](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/47367))\r\n\r\nThe `args` input argument of the `torch.onnx.export` function is updated to better support optional arguments. An optional dictionary can be passed in addition as the last argument in the `args` tuple, specifying inputs with the corresponding named parameter. Note that this is backward breaking for cases where the last input is also of a dictionary type. In the new API, for such cases, it is mandatory to have an empty dictionary as the last argument in the `args` tuple.\r\nMore details can be found at: https://pytorch.org/docs/1.8.0/onnx.html?highlight=onnx#using-dictionaries-to-handle-named-arguments-as-model-inputs.\r\n\r\n### Update signature of `torch.quantization.quantize` function [#48537](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48537)\r\n\r\nThe `run_args` argument must now contain a list or tuple containing the positional arguments, even if there is only a single argument.\r\nIn particular, code like: `qmodel = quantize(float_model, default_eval_fn, img_data)` that was working in 1.7.1 will now raise the error: `TypeError: default_eval_fn() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`.\r\nYou should update this code to provide the image in a list for example: `qmodel = quantize(float_model, default_eval_fn, [img_data])`\r\n\r\n### Change the way we quantize relu, leaky relu and sigmoid([#47415](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/47415), [#48038](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48038), [#45702,](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/45702)[#45711](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/45711), [#45883](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/45883) [#45883](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/45883), [#45882](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/45882), [#47660](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/47660)**)**\r\n\r\nStarting with version 1.8.0, in the eager mode quantization flow, relu is not observed anymore as it is not needed.\r\nIn previous versions, quantized `leaky_relu` and `sigmoid` did not require observation and just inherited the quantization parameters from their input, but that does not work very well in eager mode quantization. Starting with version 1.8.0, they are observed operator so that they work better in eager mode quantization.\r\n\r\n### Update direction numbers to 21201 dims in the SobolEngine ([#49710](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/49710))\r\n\r\nThis update is BC-breaking because the values drawn by the engine will be different from the ones drawn in 1.7.1 even with the same seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table  align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.7.1</th><th>1.8.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> from torch.quasirandom import SobolEngine\r\n>>> eng = SobolEngine(1)\r\n>>> eng.draw(3)\r\ntensor([[0.5000],\r\n            [0.7500],\r\n            [0.2500]])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> from torch.quasirandom import SobolEngine\r\n>>> eng = SobolEngine(1)\r\n>>> eng.draw(3)\r\ntensor([[0.0000],\r\n            [0.5000],\r\n            [0.7500]])\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n### Deprecate old style `nn.Module` backward hooks ([#46163](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/46163))\r\n\r\nOld style `nn.Module` backward hooks have been broken for a long time (they do not behave as advertised in the documentation).

In addition, several features moved to [stable](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html#pytorch-documentation) including custom C++ Classes, the memory profiler, the creation of custom tensor-like objects, user async functions in RPC and a number of other features in torch.distributed such as Per-RPC timeout, DDP dynamic bucketing and RRef helper. \r\n\r\nA few of the highlights include: \r\n\r\n* CUDA 11 is now officially supported with binaries available at [PyTorch.org](http://pytorch.org/)\r\n* Updates and additions to profiling and performance for RPC, TorchScript and Stack traces in the autograd profiler\r\n* (Beta) Support for NumPy compatible Fast Fourier transforms (FFT) via torch.fft\r\n* (Prototype) Support for Nvidia A100 generation GPUs and native TF32 format \r\n* (Prototype) Distributed training on Windows now supported\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, starting [PyTorch 1.6](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-feature-classification-changes/), features are now classified as stable, beta and prototype. You can see the detailed announcement [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-feature-classification-changes/). Note that the prototype features listed in this blog are available as part of this release. \r\n\r\n## Front End APIs\r\n\r\n### [Beta] NumPy Compatible torch.fft module\r\n\r\nFFT-related functionality is commonly used in a variety of scientific fields like signal processing. While PyTorch has historically supported a few FFT-related functions, the 1.7 release adds a new torch.fft module that implements FFT-related functions with the same API as NumPy.  \r\n\r\nThis new module must be imported to be used in the 1.7 release, since its name conflicts with the historic (and now deprecated) torch.fft function.\r\n\r\n**Example usage:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import torch.fft\r\n>>> t = torch.arange(4)\r\n>>> t\r\ntensor([0, 1, 2, 3])\r\n\r\n>>> torch.fft.fft(t)\r\ntensor([ 6.+0.j, -2.+2.j, -2.+0.j, -2.-2.j])\r\n\r\n>>> t = tensor([0.+1.j, 2.+3.j, 4.+5.j, 6.+7.j])\r\n>>> torch.fft.fft(t)\r\ntensor([12.+16.j, -8.+0.j, -4.-4.j,  0.-8.j])\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fft.html#torch-fft)\r\n\r\n### [Beta] C++ Support for Transformer NN Modules\r\n\r\nSince [PyTorch 1.5](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1-dot-5-released-with-new-and-updated-apis/), we\u2019ve continued to maintain parity between the python and C++ frontend APIs. This update allows developers to use the nn.transformer module abstraction from the C++ Frontend. And moreover, developers no longer need to save a module from python/JIT and load into C++ as it can now be used it in C++ directly. \r\n\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/api/classtorch_1_1nn_1_1_transformer_impl.html#_CPPv4N5torch2nn15TransformerImplE)\r\n\r\n### [Beta] torch.set_deterministic \r\n\r\nReproducibility (bit-for-bit determinism) may help identify errors when debugging or testing a program. To facilitate reproducibility, PyTorch 1.7 adds the  `torch.set_deterministic(bool)` function that can direct PyTorch operators to select deterministic algorithms when available, and to throw a runtime error if an operation may result in nondeterministic behavior. By default, the flag this function controls is false and there is no change in behavior, meaning PyTorch may implement its operations nondeterministically by default. \r\n\r\nMore precisely, when this flag is true:\r\n\r\n* Operations known to not have a deterministic implementation throw a runtime error;\r\n* Operations with deterministic variants use those variants (usually with a performance penalty versus the non-deterministic version); and\r\n* `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True` is set.\r\n\r\nNote that this is necessary, **but not sufficient**, for determinism **within a single run of a PyTorch program**. Other sources of randomness like random number generators, unknown operations, or asynchronous or distributed computation may still cause nondeterministic behavior.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation for `torch.set_deterministic(bool)` for the list of affected operations.\r\n\r\n* RFC | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/15359)\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_deterministic.html)\r\n\r\n## Performance & Profiling\r\n\r\n### [Beta] Stack traces added to profiler\r\n\r\nUsers can now see not only operator name/inputs in the profiler output table but also where the operator is in the code. The workflow requires very little change to take advantage of this capability. The user uses the [autograd profiler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#profiler) as before but with optional new parameters: `with_stack` and `group_by_stack_n`. Caution: regular profiling runs should not use this feature as it adds significant overhead. \r\n\r\n* Details | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43898/)\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html)\r\n\r\n## Distributed Training & RPC \r\n\r\n### [Stable] TorchElastic now bundled into PyTorch docker image\r\n\r\nTorchelastic offers a strict superset of the current `torch.distributed.launch` CLI with the added features for fault-tolerance and elasticity. If the user is not be interested in fault-tolerance, they can get the exact functionality/behavior parity by setting `max_restarts=0` with the added convenience of auto-assigned `RANK` and `MASTER_ADDR|PORT` (versus manually specified in `torch.distributed.launch)`.\r\n\r\nBy bundling `torchelastic` in the same docker image as PyTorch, users can start experimenting with torchelastic right-away without having to separately install `torchelastic`. In addition to convenience, this work is a nice-to-have when adding support for elastic parameters in the existing Kubeflow\u2019s distributed PyTorch operators.\r\n\r\n* Usage examples and how to get started | [Link](https://pytorch.org/elastic/0.2.0/examples.html)\r\n\r\n### [Beta] Support for uneven dataset inputs in DDP\r\n\r\nPyTorch 1.7 introduces a new context manager to be used in conjunction with models trained using `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` to enable training with uneven dataset size across different processes. This feature enables greater flexibility when using DDP and prevents the user from having to manually ensure dataset sizes are the same across different process. With this context manager, DDP will handle uneven dataset sizes automatically, which can prevent errors or hangs at the end of training.\r\n\r\n* RFC | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/38174)\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html#torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.join)\r\n\r\n### [Beta] NCCL Reliability - Async Error/Timeout Handling\r\n\r\nIn the past, NCCL training runs would hang indefinitely due to stuck collectives, leading to a very unpleasant experience for users. This feature will abort stuck collectives and throw an exception/crash the process if a potential hang is detected. When used with something like torchelastic (which can recover the training process from the last checkpoint), users can have much greater reliability for distributed training. This feature is completely opt-in and sits behind an environment variable that needs to be explicitly set in order to enable this functionality (otherwise users will see the same behavior as before).\r\n\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html?highlight=init_process_group#torch.distributed.init_process_group)\r\n* RFC | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/46874)\r\n\r\n### [Beta] TorchScript `remote` and `rpc_sync`\r\n\r\n`torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_async` has been available in TorchScript in prior releases. For PyTorch 1.7, this functionality will be extended the remaining two core RPC APIs, `torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_sync` and `torch.distributed.rpc.remote`. This will complete the major RPC APIs targeted for support in TorchScript, it allows users to use the existing python RPC APIs within TorchScript (in a script function or script method, which releases the python Global Interpreter Lock) and could possibly improve application performance in multithreaded environment.\r\n\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc.html#rpc)\r\n* Usage examples | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/58ed60c259834e324e86f3e3118e4fcbbfea8dd1/torch/testing/_internal/distributed/rpc/jit/rpc_test.py#L505-L525)\r\n\r\n### [Beta] Distributed optimizer with TorchScript support\r\n\r\nPyTorch provides a broad set of optimizers for training algorithms, and these have been used repeatedly as part of the python API. However, users often want to use multithreaded training instead of multiprocess training as it provides better resource utilization and efficiency in the context of large scale distributed training (e.g. Distributed Model Parallel) or any RPC-based training application). Users couldn\u2019t do this with with distributed optimizer before because we need to get rid of the python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitation to achieve this.\r\n\r\nIn PyTorch 1.7, we are enabling the TorchScript support in distributed optimizer to remove the GIL, and make it possible to run optimizer in multithreaded applications. The new distributed optimizer has the exact same interface as before but it automatically converts optimizers within each worker into TorchScript to make each GIL free. This is done by leveraging a functional optimizer concept and allowing the distributed optimizer to convert the computational portion of the optimizer into TorchScript. This will help use cases like distributed model parallel training and improve performance using multithreading. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the only optimizer that supports automatic conversion with TorchScript is `Adagrad` and all other optimizers will still work as before without TorchScript support. We are working on expanding the coverage to all PyTorch optimizers and expect more to come in future releases. The usage to enable TorchScript support is automatic and exactly the same with existing python APIs, here is an example of how to use this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch.distributed.autograd as dist_autograd\r\nimport torch.distributed.rpc as rpc\r\nfrom torch import optim\r\nfrom torch.distributed.optim import DistributedOptimizer\r\n\r\nwith dist_autograd.context() as context_id:\r\n  # Forward pass.\r\n  rref1 = rpc.remote(\"worker1\", torch.add, args=(torch.ones(2), 3))\r\n  rref2 = rpc.remote(\"worker1\", torch.add, args=(torch.ones(2), 1))\r\n  loss = rref1.to_here() + rref2.to_here()\r\n\r\n  # Backward pass.\r\n  dist_autograd.backward(context_id, [loss.sum()])\r\n\r\n  # Optimizer, pass in optim.Adagrad, DistributedOptimizer will\r\n  # automatically convert/compile it to TorchScript (GIL-free)\r\n  dist_optim = DistributedOptimizer(\r\n     optim.Adagrad,\r\n     [rref1, rref2],\r\n     lr=0.05,\r\n  )\r\n  dist_optim.step(context_id)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/rpc.html#module-torch.distributed.optim)\r\n* RFC | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/46883)\r\n\r\n### [Beta] Enhancements to RPC-based Profiling\r\n\r\nSupport for using the PyTorch profiler in conjunction with the RPC framework was first introduced in PyTorch 1.6. In PyTorch 1.7, the following enhancements have been made:\r\n\r\n* Implemented better support for profiling TorchScript functions over RPC\r\n* Achieved parity in terms of profiler features that work with RPC\r\n* Added support for asynchronous RPC functions on the server-side (functions decorated with `rpc.functions.async_execution)`.\r\n\r\nUser are now able to use familiar profiling tools such as `with torch.autograd.profiler.profile()` and `with torch.autograd.profiler.record_function,` and this works transparently with the RPC framework with full feature support, profiles asynchronous functions, and TorchScript functions.\r\n\r\n* Design doc | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/39675)\r\n* Usage examples | [Link](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/distributed_rpc_profiling.html)\r\n\r\n### [Prototype] Windows support for Distributed Training\r\n\r\nPyTorch 1.7 brings prototype support for `DistributedDataParallel` and collective communications on the Windows platform. In this release, the support only covers Gloo-based `ProcessGroup` and `FileStore`.\r\nTo use this feature across multiple machines, please provide a file from a shared file system in `init_process_group`. \r\n\r\n```python\r\n# initialize the process group\r\ndist.init_process_group(\r\n    \"gloo\",\r\n    # multi-machine example:\r\n    # Shared files need six \"/\"\r\n    # init_method = `\"file://////{machine}/{share_folder}/file\"`\r\n    # Local file need three \"/\"\r\n    init_method=\"file:///{your local file path}\",\r\n    rank=rank,\r\n    world_size=world_size\r\n)\r\n\r\nmodel = DistributedDataParallel(local_model, device_ids=[rank])\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Design doc | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/42095)\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/distributed.html#backends-that-come-with-pytorch)\r\n* Acknowledgement | [gunandrose4u](https://github.com/gunandrose4u)\r\n\r\n## Mobile\r\n\r\nPyTorch Mobile supports both [iOS](https://pytorch.org/mobile/ios) and [Android](https://pytorch.org/mobile/android/) with binary packages available in [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) and J[Center](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/jcenter) respectively. You can learn more about PyTorch-Mobile [here](https://pytorch.org/mobile/home/). \r\n\r\n### [Beta] PyTorch Mobile Caching allocator for performance improvements\r\n\r\nOn some mobile platforms, such as Pixel, we observed that memory is returned to the system more aggressively. This results in frequent page faults as PyTorch being a functional framework does not maintain state for the operators. Thus outputs are allocated dynamically on each execution of the op, for the most ops. To ameliorate performance penalties due to this, PyTorch 1.7 provides a simple caching allocator for CPU. The allocator caches allocations by tensor sizes and, is currently, available only via the PyTorch C++ API. The caching allocator itself is owned by client and thus the lifetime of the allocator is also maintained by client code. Such a client owned caching allocator can then be used with scoped guard, `c10::WithCPUCachingAllocatorGuard`, to enable the use of cached allocation within that scope.\r\n\r\n**Example usage:**\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <c10/mobile/CPUCachingAllocator.h>\r\n.....\r\nc10::CPUCachingAllocator caching_allocator;\r\n  // Owned by client code. Can be a member of some client class so as to tie the\r\n  // the lifetime of caching allocator to that of the class.\r\n.....\r\n{\r\n  c10::optional<c10::WithCPUCachingAllocatorGuard> caching_allocator_guard;\r\n  if (FLAGS_use_caching_allocator) {\r\n    caching_allocator_guard.emplace(&caching_allocator);\r\n  }\r\n  ....\r\n  model.forward(..);\r\n}\r\n.....\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Caching allocator is only available on mobile builds, thus the use of caching allocator outside of mobile builds won\u2019t be effective.\r\n\r\n* Documentation | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/c10/mobile/CPUCachingAllocator.h#L13-L43)\r\n* Usage examples | [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/binaries/speed_benchmark_torch.cc#L207)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Backwards Incompatible changes\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n### `torch.conj` now returns the input as-is for real Tensors ([#43270](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43270))\r\n\r\nPreviously, `torch.conj` and `Tensor.conj` were making a clone for Tensors of real dtype. It now returns the Tensor as-is to improve performance.\r\nYou can recover the original behavior by adding a `.clone()` for real Tensors.\r\nNote that this behavior is different from `numpy` for which `np.conj` returns a new ndarray and `ndarray.conj` returns the ndarray as-is.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.6.0</th><th>1.7.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.is_complex()\r\nFalse\r\n>>> t.conj() is t\r\nFalse   \r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.is_complex()\r\nFalse\r\n>>> t.conj() is t\r\nTrue\r\n>>>t.conj().clone() is t\r\nFalse   \r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### `torch.tensor`, `torch.as_tensor`, and `torch.sparse_coo_tensor` now use the input Tensor\u2019s device when it is not specified ([#41984](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/41984))\r\n\r\nThis will change the device on which the Tensor is created and so the user can start seeing device mismatch errors.\r\nIt also means for sparse Tensors that both of the provided Tensors must be on the same device if the device is not specified.\r\nYou can recover the original behavior by passing the `device` argument.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.6.0</th><th>1.7.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.device\r\ndevice(type=\u2018cuda:0\u2019)\r\n>>> # tensor constructor\r\n>>> torch.tensor(t, dtype=torch.float32).device\r\ndevice(type=\u2018cpu\u2019)\r\n>>> # sparse constructor\r\n>>> torch.sparse_coo_tensor(\r\n            torch.tensor(([0], [2]), device=\"cpu\"),\r\n            torch.tensor(([1.],), device=\"cuda\"),\r\n            size=(3, 3, 1)).device\r\ndevice(type='cuda', index=0)    \r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.device\r\ndevice(type=\u2018cuda:0\u2019)\r\n>>> # tensor constructor\r\n>>> torch.tensor(t, dtype=torch.float32).device\r\ndevice(type=\u2018cuda:0\u2019)\r\n>>> # Specify the device to get the same behavior as 1.6\r\n>>> torch.tensor(t, dtype=torch.float32, device='cpu').device\r\ndevice(type=\u2018cpu\u2019)\r\n>>> # sparse constructor\r\n>>> torch.sparse_coo_tensor(\r\n            torch.tensor(([0], [2]), device=\"cpu\"),\r\n            torch.tensor(([1.],), device=\"cuda\"),\r\n            size=(3, 3, 1)).device\r\nRuntimeError: backend of indices (CPU) must match backend\r\nof values (CUDA)\r\n>>> # Specify the device to get the same behavior as 1.6\r\n>>> torch.sparse_coo_tensor(\r\n            torch.tensor(([0], [2]), device=\"cpu\"),\r\n            torch.tensor(([1.],), device=\"cuda\"),\r\n            size=(3, 3, 1),\r\n            device=\"cuda:0\").device\r\ndevice(type='cuda', index=0)    \r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### `torch.nn.utils.pack_padded_sequence`: remove hidden cross-device copy for `lengths` ([#41984](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/41984))\r\n\r\nIn previous versions, when the lengths argument was a CUDA tensor, it would incorrectly be moved to the CPU silently.\r\nThis can lead to surprising performances and CPU/GPU sync when using CUDA so this has been removed.\r\nYou need to make sure that the provided `lenghts` is a CPU Tensor when it is provided as a Tensor.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.6.0</th><th>1.7.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> inp = torch.rand(10, 2, 3, device=\"cuda\")\r\n>>> lengths = torch.tensor([10, 7], device=\"cuda\")\r\n>>> torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(inp, lengths)\r\n>>> # Implicitly move lengths to the CPU and runs fine\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> inp = torch.rand(10, 2, 3, device=\"cuda\")\r\n>>> lengths = torch.tensor([10, 7], device=\"cuda\")\r\n>>> torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(inp, lengths)\r\nRuntimeError: 'lengths' argument should be a 1D CPU int64 tensor,\r\nbut got 1D cuda:0 Long tensor\r\n>>> # Ensure the lenghts is already on the right device\r\n>>> lengths = lengths.cpu()\r\n>>> torch.nn.utils.rnn.pack_padded_sequence(inp, lengths)\r\n>>> # Runs fine with no implicit move across device\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Improve `torch.norm` handling of `keepdim=True` ([#41956](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/41956))\r\n\r\nBefore this change, when calling `torch.norm` with `keepdim=True` and `p='fro'` or `p=number`, leaving all other optional arguments as their default values, the keepdim argument would be ignored. It is now properly respected.\r\nAlso, any time `torch.norm` was called with `p='nuc'` and `keepdim=True`, the result would have one fewer dimension than the input, and the dimensions could be out of order depending on which dimensions were being reduced. It is now properly keeping all the dimensions.\r\nYou can recover the original behavior by setting `keepdim=False`.\r\n**NOTE: this function is now deprecated (see below) and we recommend you use `torch.linalg.norm`, which follows NumPy\u2019s conventions.**\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.6.0</th><th>1.7.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.size()\r\ntorch.Size([4, 4])\r\n>>> t.norm(p=\u2018fro\u2019, keepdim=True).size()\r\ntorch.size([])\r\n>>> t.norm(p=3, keepdim=True).size()\r\ntorch.size([])\r\n>>> t.norm(p=\u2018nuc\u2019, keepdim=True).size()\r\ntorch.size([1]) \r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> t.size()\r\ntorch.Size([4, 4])\r\n>>> t.norm(p=\u2018fro\u2019, keepdim=True).size()\r\ntorch.size([1, 1])\r\n>>> t.norm(p=3, keepdim=True).size()\r\ntorch.size([1, 1])\r\n>>> t.norm(p=\u2018nuc\u2019, keepdim=True).size()\r\ntorch.size([1, 1])  \r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### `torch.split` and `torch.chunk`: Fix view tracking for the autograd ([#41567](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/41567))\r\n\r\nThe autograd system is able to correctly handle modifications through views of Tensors by explicitly tracking known view operations. In prior releases, `torch.split` and `torch.chunk` were not marked as known view operations, which could lead to silently wrong gradients.\r\n\r\nNote that since v1.5, inplace modification of views created by functions that return multiple views is deprecated. Such case is not properly handled by the autograd and can lead to internal errors or wrong gradients. So, as a side effect of this view fix, inplace modifications of the outputs of `torch.split` and `torch.chunk` will now raise a warning and can lead to internal errors or wrong gradients while they were previously silently computing wrong gradients.\r\nIf you see such a warning, you should replace the inplace operation with an out of place one.\r\nYou can recover the original behavior by using the new `torch.unsafe_split` and `torch.unsafe_chunk`. Note that these functions are only here to ease the transition and will also be removed in a future version.\r\n\r\n### `torch.{argmin,argmax}` now always return the first min/max index ([#42004](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/42004))\r\n\r\n`torch.argmin` (`torch.argmax`) now always returns the index of the first minimum (maximum) element. This choice is consistent with NumPy. Previously if there were multiple minima (maxima) the index returned could be the index of any of them.\r\nYou cannot recover the original behavior as it was platform dependent and not guaranteed. If your code was relying on a specific index for your specific platform, you should update it to work with the first index and this new code will work on all platforms.\r\n\r\n### `torch.{min,max,median}`: Update backward formula when doing full reduction (`dim` argument not provided) ([#43519](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43519))\r\n\r\nWhen no dimension is specified, full reduction is performed and the gradient will now flow back evenly towards all the input that realized the output value. The old behavior was to propagate the gradient only for one of such input selected arbitrarily.\r\nThis should improve stability of training by gradient descent.\r\nTo recover the previous behavior, you can perform the reduction with the `dim=` argument.

This means that code for which the `.backward()` or `autograd.grad()` final result will now be `None` while it used to be a Tensor full of zeros.\r\nYou can recover the previous behavior by having your custom `autograd.Function` materialize the zero Tensor with `torch.zeros_like(input)` to replace the `None` output for the `backward` method.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\n# Custom Function that returns None for the gradient\r\nclass GetTwos(torch.autograd.Function):\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def forward(ctx, inp):\r\n        return inp.clone().fill_(2)\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def backward(ctx, grad_out):\r\n        # To recover the 1.6 behavior, replace the line below with `return torch.zeros_like(grad_out)`\r\n        return None\r\n\r\na = torch.rand(10, requires_grad=True)\r\nb = GetTwos.apply(a)\r\nb.sum().backward()\r\n\r\nprint(a.grad)\r\n# In PyTorch 1.6 this will print\r\n# tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\r\n# In PyTorch 1.7 this will print\r\n# None\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fix inplace detection for non-differentiable outputs ([#41269](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/41269))\r\n\r\nWe fixed a bug in the inplace detection code that was preventing the detection of some inplace operations for output that are not differentiable (like integer type Tensors).\r\nThis can lead to code that used to run fine to throw the error \u201ca Tensor that was needed for backward was modified in an inplace operation\u201d.\r\nSuch failure is true and the user code must be fixed to compute proper gradients. In general, this involves cloning the Tensor before modifying it inplace to make sure the backward pass can happen safely.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\na = torch.rand(10, requires_grad=True)\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    a[2] = 10\r\n\r\nb, ind = a.max(dim=0)\r\n# ind is 2 here\r\n\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n    t = torch.rand(10)\r\n    t[4] = 10\r\n    res = torch.max(t, dim=0, out=(torch.Tensor(), ind))\r\n    # ind becomes 4 here\r\n\r\n# This backward runs in 1.6 but will fail in 1.7\r\nb.sum().backward()\r\nprint(a.grad)\r\n# tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\r\n# The value is wrong is at index 4 while it should be at index 2\r\n\r\n# The issue is avoided by not modifying ind inplace by replacing the line\r\n# above with:\r\n# res = torch.max(t, dim=0, out=(torch.Tensor(), ind.clone()))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Add `__torch_functions__` for methods ([#37091](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/37091))\r\n\r\nFunctions, slicing and Tensor methods will now properly preserve the subclass type when possible.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> class SubTensor(torch.Tensor):\r\n...     pass\r\n>>> type(torch.add(SubTensor([0]), SubTensor([1]))).__name__\r\n'SubTensor'\r\n>>> type(torch.add(SubTensor([0]), torch.Tensor([1]))).__name__\r\n'SubTensor'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe old behavior of \u201cany operations on your subclass produces a torch.Tensor instead of the subclass\u201d can be recovered by doing:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom torch._C import _disabled_torch_function_impl\r\n    \r\nclass SubTensor(torch.Tensor):\r\n    __torch_function__ = _disabled_torch_function_impl\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor all details on how to use this feature, please refer to the [doc](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html#extending-torch) page for it.\r\n\r\n### `tensor.__iter__`: Use `torch.unbind` instead of a for loop ([#40884](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/40884))\r\n\r\nThis improves performances significantly but it changes the behavior of in-place operations on the value returned by the iterator. This happens only if either the input Tensor or any argument of the in-place operation is a Tensor that requires gradients. And it will fail with \"Output X of UnbindBackward is a view and is being modified inplace\".\r\nYou can recover the previous behavior by manually slicing the Tensor: `[t[i] for i in range(t.size(0))]` as shown in the example below.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <table align=\"center\">\r\n    <tr><th>1.6.0</th><th>1.7.0</th></tr>\r\n    <tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> x = torch.randn(5, 10, requires_grad=True)\r\n>>> for i, v in enumerate(x):\r\n>>>     v.fill_(i)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n      <td><sub><pre lang=\"python\">\r\n>>> x = torch.randn(5, 10, requires_grad=True)\r\n>>> for i, v in enumerate([x[j] for j in range(x.size(0))]):\r\n>>>   v.fill_(i)\r\n      </pre></sub></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </table>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n### Updated most function that take zero, one or two Tensor arguments and indexing op to check for memory overlap in the Tensor being worked on ([#43418](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43418), [#43419](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43419), [#43](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43420)[420](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43420), [#43421](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43421), [#43423](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43423), [#43422](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/43422))\r\n\r\nIt fixes silent correctness errors: something that used to be silently incorrect now errors out. Code that raises this error must be updated to avoid doing such op that was returning wrong results as shown in the example below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> x = torch.randn(1, 3)\r\n>>> # Create a tensor that has internal memory overlap\r\n>>> y = x.expand(2, 3)\r\n\r\n# In 1.6, this would not error out, but in 1.7, this errors out\r\n>>> torch.nn.functional.elu(y, inplace=True)\r\nRuntimeError: unsupported operation: more than one element of the written-to tensor refers to a single m\r\nemory location. Please clone() the tensor before performing the operation.\r\n\r\n# Here is the fix in 1.7\r\n>>> torch.nn.functional.elu(y, inplace=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nc++ API: Any external users of `TensorIterator` now always get the memory overlap check. The previous behavior can be recovered by setting `set_check_mem_overlap(false)` when creating the iterator.\r\n\r\n## TorchScript\r\n\r\n### TorchScript now correctly supports various exception type and custom exception message ([#41907](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/41907))\r\n\r\n* Exceptions raised in TorchScript was traditionally replaced with a generic runtime error that doesn\u2019t carry exception type or message, leading to crashes that are difficult to pin-point and debug. We improved TorchScript to correctly parse exception types and messages and surface them to users. \r\n* This change is backward incompatible because TorchScript now attempts to compile user code that creates custom exception messages instead of ignoring them. Any TorchScript-incompatible Python features used in those code snippets would lead to failures.\r\n* There is no fixed formula to fix this backward incompatibility failure other than updating code that generates exceptions to be TorchScript-able.\r\n\r\n### TorchScript now supports properties of TorchScript classes and ScriptModules ([#42389](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/42389), [#42390](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/42390))\r\n\r\n* TorchScript added support for `@property` of TorchScript classes and ScriptModules. Custom setters and getters are also supported. Custom deleters are not supported.\r\n* This improvement is backward incompatible because TorchScript now attempts to script properties of existing classes and `Modules`. If these properties use Python or Pytorch features that are not supported in Torchscript, scripting will fail.\r\n* There are two ways of fixing backward incompatibility failures introduced by this change. One is using `@torch.jit.unused` to annotate problematic properties, the other is to update the implementation of the property so that the getter and setter are scriptable.\r\n\r\n## Quantization\r\n\r\n### The convolution parameters now support versioning.\r\n\r\n* This change means that any quantized convolution module **saved** using PyTorch 1.7+ cannot be loaded in v1.6 and lower.\r\n* But this change is backward compatible: if the model (with conv layers) is saved in version 1.6, it can be safely loaded in version 1.7.\r\n\r\n## Some undocumented functions that were mistakenly made public have been removed\r\n\r\n* `torch.absolute_` has been removed, the Tensor method (`Tensor.absolute_`) should be used instead just like all other inplace ops.\r\n* `torch.ExtraFilesMap` is an internal jit construct and should not be used.\r\n\r\n## TorchScript Compiler Update\r\n\r\nIn 1.7, we are enabling a Profiling Executor and a new Tensor-Expressions-based (TE) Fuser. All compilations will now go through one (an adjustable setting) profiling run and one optimization run. For the profiling run, complete tensor shapes are recorded and used by the new Fuser. For the optimization run, the focus is on finding (in `torch.jit.ScriptModule`s) and fusing element-wise operations over CUDA tensors into a single CUDA kernel.\r\n\r\nThe TE fuser is expected to deliver performance similar to the old fuser used in 1.6. It however unlocks more opportunities for performance improvements in future releases. In rare cases, performance of some models may degrade 5-10%. If you experience any regressions please report it on Github, so we can address them as soon as possible! For 1.7, we are providing an option for our users to revert back to the old fuser by calling `torch._C._jit_set_profiling_executor(False)` in Python and `torch::jit::getExecutorMode()`` = false;` in C++. For more information, please see [\u201cGraph Executor\u201d section](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/csrc/jit/OVERVIEW.md#graph-executor) in our documentation.\r\n\r\n# Deprecations\r\n\r\n## Python API\r\n\r\n### `torch.norm` and `torch.functional.norm` are deprecated in favor of `torch.linalg.norm` ([#44321](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/44321))\r\n\r\nThe new `torch.linalg.norm` has the same behavior as `numpy.linalg.norm`\r\nBoth deprecated functions had odd behaviors for matrix and vector norms.
