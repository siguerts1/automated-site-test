Thanks! \u2764\ufe0f\r\n\r\n### Minimum Go version: 1.19\r\n\r\nViper now requires Go 1.19\r\n\r\nThis change ensures we can stay up to date with modern practices and dependencies.\r\n\r\n### `log/slog` support **[BREAKING]**\r\n\r\nViper [v1.11.0](https://github.com/spf13/viper/releases/tag/v1.11.0) added an experimental `Logger` interface to allow custom implementations (besides [jwalterweatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jwalterweatherman)).\r\n\r\nIn addition, it also exposed an experimental `WithLogger` function allowing to set a custom logger.\r\n\r\nThis release deprecates that interface in favor of [log/slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog) released in Go 1.21.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> `WithLogger` accepts an [*slog.Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog#Logger) from now on.\r\n\r\nTo preserve backwards compatibility with older Go versions, prior to Go 1.21 Viper accepts a [*golang.org/x/exp/slog.Logger](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slog#Logger).\r\n\r\nThe experimental flag is removed.\r\n\r\n### New finder implementation **[BREAKING]**\r\n\r\nAs of this release, Viper uses a new library to look for files, called [locafero](https://github.com/sagikazarmark/locafero).\r\n\r\nThe new library is better covered by tests and has been built from scratch as a general purpose file finder library.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is experimental and is hidden behind a `finder` build tag.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> The `io/fs` based implementation (that used to be hidden behind a `finder` build tag) has been removed.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n### Exciting New Features \ud83c\udf89\r\n* Add NATS support by @hooksie1 in
