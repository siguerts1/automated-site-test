([#2176](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2176))\r\n\r\nRego tests now support parameterization, allowing a single test rule to include multiple, hierarchical, named test cases.\r\nThis feature is useful for data-driven testing, where a single test rule can be used for multiple test cases with different inputs and expected outputs.\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage

    "body": "> **_NOTES:_**\r\n>\r\n> * The minimum version of Go required to build the OPA module is **1.22**\r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce **OPA 1.0**, a milestone release consolidating an improved developer experience for the future of Policy as Code. The release makes new functionality designed to simplify policy writing and improve the language's consistency the default.\r\n\r\n### Changes to Rego in OPA 1.0\r\n\r\nBelow we highlight some key changes to the defaults in OPA 1.0:\r\n\r\n- Using `if` for all rule definitions and `contains` for multi-value rules is now mandatory, not just when using the `rego.v1` import.\r\n- Other new keywords (`every`, `in`) are available without any imports.\r\n- Some requirements that were previously only run in \"strict mode\" (`opa check --strict`) are now the default. Duplicate imports and imports which shadow each other are no longer allowed.\r\n- OPA 1.0 comes with a range of backwards compatibility features to aid your migrations, please see the [v0 compatibility guide](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/v0-compatibility/)\r\nif you must continue to support v0 Rego.\r\n\r\nRead more about the OPA 1.0 announcement [here](https://blog.openpolicyagent.org/announcing-opa-1-0-a-new-standard-for-policy-as-code-a6d8427ee828) on our blog.\r\n\r\nFollowing are other changes that are included in OPA 1.0.\r\n\r\n### Improvements to memory allocations\r\n\r\nPRs [#7172](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7172), [#7190](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7190), [#7193](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7193), [#7165](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7165), [#7168](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7168), [#7191](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7191) & [#7222](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7222) together improve the memory performance of OPA. Key strategies\r\ninclude reusing pointers and optimizing array and object operations, minimizing intermediate object creation, and using `sync.Pool` \r\nto manage memory-heavy operations. These changes cumulatively greatly reduced the number of allocations and improved\r\nevaluation speed by 10-20%. Additional benchmarks highlighted significant memory and speed improvements in custom\r\nfunction evaluation.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @anderseknert.\r\n\r\n### Wrap http.RoundTripper for SDK users\r\n\r\nPR [#7180](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7180) adds an `EvalHTTPRoundTrip` EvalOption and query-level `WithHTTPRoundTrip` option.\r\nBoth use a new function type which converts an `http.Transport` configured by topdown to an `http.RoundTripper`.\r\nThis supports use cases requiring the customization of the `http.send` built in behavior.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @evankanderson.\r\n\r\n### Improvements to scientific notation parsing in `units.parse`\r\n\r\nPR [#7147](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7147) extends the behaviour of `extractNumAndUnit` to support\r\nscientific notation values. This means values such as `1e3KB` can now be handled by this function.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @berdanA.\r\n\r\n### Support customized buckets `bundle_loading_duration_ns` metric\r\n\r\nPR [#7156](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7156) extends OPA\u2019s Prometheus configuration to allow the\r\nsetting of user defined buckets for metrics. This aids when debugging the loading of slow bundles.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @jwu730-1.\r\n\r\n### Test suite performance improvements\r\n\r\nPR [#7126](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7126) updates tests to improve performance. Topdown and `storage/disk/`\r\ntests now run around 50% and 75% faster respectively.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @philipaconrad.\r\n\r\n### OPA 1.0 Preparation\r\n\r\n- Update v1 capabilities by @johanfylling in [#7216](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7216)\r\n- v1 API by @johanfylling in [#7215](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7215)\r\n- Updating formatter to not drop `rego.v1` and `future.keywords` imports for v1 by @johanfylling in [#7224](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7224)\r\n- Update docs and server binding address per OPA 1.0 specs by @ashutosh-narkar & @charlieegan3 in [#7140](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7140)\r\n- Renaming `--rego-v1` cmd flag to `--v0-v1` by @johanfylling in [#7225](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7225)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- Provide a more useful error message when there are conflicting default rules by @tjons in [#7164](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7164)\r\n- Fix test flakes in `topdown/cache` by @evankanderson in [#7188](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7188)\r\n- Add description to all built-in function args and return values by @anderseknert in [#7153](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7153)\r\n- Built-in function `to_number` now rejects \"Inf\", \"Infinity\" and \"NaN\" values by @sikehish in [#7203](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7203)\r\n- Update eval_cancel_error logic to separate context canceled, timeout errors by @mchitten in [#7202](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7202)\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- Respect runtime rego-version in RESTful policy API by @johanfylling in [#7183](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7183)\r\n- Debugger: allow YAML to be used as input by @anderseknert in [#7178](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7178)\r\n- `opa build`: provide an option to preserve print statements for the \"wasm\" target (#7194) by @me-viper in [#7195](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7195)\r\n- Fix improper formatter behavior when comprehension contains comment by @tjons in [#7169](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7169)\r\n- runtime: send version report less often when OPA long-running by @srenatus in [#7211](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7211)\r\n- `opa eval`: Return error if illegal arguments passed with `--unknowns` flag by @kd-labs in [#7149](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7149)\r\n- Enable direct error handling for bundle plugin trigger method by @torwunder in [#7143](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7143)\r\n\r\n### Docs, Website, Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Add VodafoneZiggo as adopters by @Parsifal-M in [#7154](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7154)\r\n- Add opa-java-wasm to docs by @andreaTP in [#7199](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7199)\r\n\r\n### Dependency Updates\r\n\r\n- (build) golangci-lint: v1.59.1 -> v1.60.1 by @srenatus in [#7175](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7175)\r\n- github.com/containerd/containerd: v1.7.23 -> v1.7.24\r\n- github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify: v1.7.0 -> v1.8.0\r\n- golang.org/x/net: v0.30.0 -> v0.33.0\r\n- golang.org/x/time: v0.7.0 -> v0.8.0\r\n- google.golang.org/grpc: v1.67.1 -> v1.69.2\r\n- go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp: v0.53.0 -> v0.58.0\r\n- go.opentelemetry.io/otel: v1.28.0 -> v1.33.0\r\n- go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace: v1.28.0 -> v1.33.0\r\n- go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc: v1.28.0 -> v1.33.0\r\n- go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk: v1.28.0 -> v1.33.0\r\n- go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace: v1.28.0 -> v1.33.0\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This removes the time spent converting raw data values to AST\r\nduring policy evaluation, thereby improving performance.\r\n\r\nThe memory footprint of the store will increase, as processed AST values generally take up more space in memory than the\r\ncorresponding raw data values, but overall memory usage of OPA might remain more stable over time, as pre-converted data\r\nis shared across evaluations and isn't recomputed for each evaluation, which can cause spikes in memory usage.\r\n\r\nThis mode can be enabled for `opa run`, `opa eval`, and `opa bench` by setting the `--optimize-store-for-read-speed` flag.\r\n\r\nMore information about this feature can be found [here](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.70.0/policy-performance/#storage-optimization).\r\n\r\nCo-authored by @johanfylling and @ashutosh-narkar.\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n- topdown: Use new Inter-Query Value Cache for `json.match_schema` built-in function ([#7011](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7011)) authored by @anderseknert reported by @lcarva\r\n- ast: Fix location text attribute for multi-value rules with generated body  ([#7128](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7128)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- ast: Fix regression in `opa check` where a file that referenced non-provided schemas failed validation ([#7124](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7124)) authored by @tjons\r\n- test/cases/testdata: Fix bug in test by replacing unification by explicit equality check ([#7093](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7093)) authored by @matajoh\r\n- ast: Replace use of yaml.v2 library with yaml.v3. The earlier version would parse `yes`/`no` values as boolean. The usage of yaml.v2 in the parser was unintentional and now has been updated to yaml.v3 ([#7090](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7090)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n- cmd: Make `opa check` respect `--ignore` when `--bundle` flag is set ([#7136](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7136)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- server/writer: Properly handle result encoding errors which earlier on failure would emit logs such as `superfluous call to WriteHeader()` while still returning `200` HTTP status code. Now, errors encoding the payload properly lead to `500` HTTP status code, without extra logs. Also use Header().Set() not Header().Add() to avoid duplicate content-type headers  ([#7114](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7114)) authored by @srenatus\r\n- cmd: Support `file://` format for TLS key material file flags in `opa run` ([#7094](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7094)) authored by @alexrohozneanu\r\n- plugins/rest/azure: Support managed identity for App Service / Container Apps ([#7085](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7085)) reported and authored by @apc-kamezaki\r\n- debug: Fix step-over behaviour when exiting partial rules ([#7096](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7096)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- util+plugins: Fix potential memory leaks with explicit timer cancellation ([#7089](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7089)) authored by @philipaconrad\r\n\r\n### Docs, Website, Ecosystem\r\n- docs: Fix OCI example with updated flag used by the ORAS CLI  ([#7130](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7130)) authored by @b3n3d17\r\n- docs: Delete Atom editor from supported editor integrations ([#7111](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7111)) authored by @KaranbirSingh7\r\n- docs/website: Add Styra OPA ASP.NET Core SDK integration ([#7073](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7073)) authored by @philipaconrad\r\n- docs/website: Update compatibility information on the rego-cpp integration ([#7078](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7078)) authored by @matajoh\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n- Dependency updates; notably:\r\n  - build(deps): bump github.com/containerd/containerd from 1.7.22 to 1.7.23\r\n  - build(deps): bump github.com/prometheus/client_golang from 1.20.4 to 1.20.5\r\n  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/net from 0.29.0 to 0.30.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/time from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.67.0 to 1.67.1\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "This release contains a mix of features, bugfixes and necessary tooling and test changes required to support the upcoming OPA `1.0` release.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Inter-Query Value Cache ([#6908](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6908))\r\n\r\nOPA now has a new inter-query value cache added to the SDK. It is intended to be used for values that are expensive to compute and can be reused across multiple queries. The cache can be leveraged by built-in functions to store values that otherwise aren't appropriate for the existing inter-query cache; for instance when the entry size isn't an appropriate or primary limiting factor for cache eviction.\r\n\r\nThe default size of the inter-query value cache is unbounded, but can be configured via the `caching.inter_query_builtin_value_cache.max_num_entries` configuration field. OPA will drop random items from the cache if this limit is exceeded.\r\n\r\nThe cache is used by the `regex` and `glob` built-in functions, which previously had individual, non-configurable caches with a max entry size of `100` each.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the cache is only exercised when running OPA in server mode (ie. `opa run -s`). Also this feature is unsupported for WASM.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @ashutosh-narkar, reported by @amirsalarsafaei\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- Future-proofing tests in the `ast`, `topdown`, `rego` etc. packages to be `1.0` compatible (authored by @johanfylling)\r\n- ast: Attach annotation to static part of rule ref ([#7050](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7050)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- ast: Make `Module.String()` include `if`/`contains` for v1 modules ([#6973](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6973)) authored by @johanfylling reported by @nikpivkin\r\n- topdown/http: Stop `http.send` latency timer when an error is encountered ([#7007](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7007)) authored by @lukyer\r\n- ast/compile: Refactor local variable replacement and replace declared variables in `with`'s target ([#6979](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6979)) authored by @srenatus reported by @bluebrown\r\n- ast: Update type checker to cache schema types ([#6970](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6970)) authored by @nikpivkin\r\n- test: Fix indentation in a YAML test case ([#7039](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7039)) authored by @matajoh\r\n- format: Bracketing keyword ref elements in formatter output ([#7010](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7010)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- Future-proofing tests in the `sdk`, `downlaod`, `server` , `cmd` etc. packages to be `1.0` compatible (authored by @johanfylling)\r\n- cmd: Add `--v0-compatible` flag to make OPA behave as `v0.x` post `v1.0` release ([#7065](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7065)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- util: Strip  UTF-8 BOM from input JSON when found ([#6988](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6988)) authored by @anderseknert reported by @adhilto\r\n- plugins/rest: Support reading AWS token from the filesystem for the AWS container credential provider ([#6997](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6997)) authored by @cmaddalozzo\r\n- debug: Add `RegoOption` launch option to debugger for setting custom Rego options ([#7045](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7045)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- debug: Always include `Input` and `Data` variable scopes to ease discoverability of the scopes ([#7074](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7074)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- wasm: Fix arithmetic comparison for large numbers, caused by an integer overflow ([#6991](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6991)) authored by @Ptroger\r\n\r\n### Docs, Website, Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Add Marsh McLennan to adopters ([#7060](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7060)) authored by @anderseknert reported by @pratimsc\r\n- Add APIwiz to adopters ([#7067](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7067)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- docs: Fix misnomer in OPA-Istio tutorial to document Istio's AuthorizationPolicy API ([#6984](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6984)) authored by @tjons\r\n- docs: Readme updates to highlight more up-to-date information about OPA ([#7066](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7066)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- docs: Update documentation to show Debug API uses ([#7036](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7036))  authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- docs: Simplify the OPA-Istio tutorial example policy ([#7059](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7059)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- website: Update policy examples on the OPA home page to be `1.0` compatible  ([#7033](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7033))  authored by @charlieegan3\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- build: Bump github.com/golang/glob, remove replace directive ([#7024](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/7024)) authored by @srenatus reported by @mmannerm\r\n- Dependency updates; notably:\r\n  - build(deps): bump github.com/containerd/containerd from 1.7.21 to 1.7.22\r\n  - build(deps): bump github.com/prometheus/client_golang from 1.20.2 to 1.20.4\r\n  - build(deps): bump go.uber.org/automaxprocs from 1.5.3 to 1.6.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/net from 0.28.0 to 0.29.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.66.0 to 1.67.0\r\n  - build(go): bump 1.22.5 to 1.23.1 ([#7006](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/7006)) authored by @srenatus\r\n\r\n",

Furthermore, if no `scope` annotation is declared for a METADATA block preceding a rule, the presence of an `entrypoint` annotation with a `true` value will assign the block a `document` scope, where the `rule` scope is otherwise the default.\r\n\r\nIn practice, a rule entrypoint always point to the entire document and not a particular rule definition. The previous behavior was a bug, and one we've now addressed.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @anderseknert\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- ast: Fixing nil-pointer dereference in compiler for partial rule edge case ([#6930](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6930)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- ast+parser: Add hint to future-proof imports ([6968](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6968)) authored by @srenatus\r\n- topdown: Adding unification scope to virtual-cache key.

([#6923](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6923)) authored by @srenatus\r\n  Note that the flag is now unnecessary, but it's kept so existing calls like `opa exec -fjson ...` remain valid.\r\n\r\n#### Security Fix: CVE-2024-8260 ([#6933](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6933))\r\n\r\nThis release includes a fix where OPA would accept UNC locations on Windows. Reading those could leak NTLM hashes.\r\nThe attack vector would include an adversary tricking the user in passing an UNC path to OPA, e.g. `opa eval -d $FILE`.\r\nUNC paths are now forbidden. If this is an issue for you, please reach out on Slack or GitHub issues.\r\n\r\nReported by Shelly Raban\r\nAuthored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n\r\n### Docs, Website, Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- docs: Suggest using `opa-config.yaml` as name for config file (#6966) ([#6959](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6959)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- docs: Add documentation for OPA Spring Boot integration ([#6898](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6898)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- docs: Update Istio tutorial ([#6896](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6896)) authored by @Pindar\r\n- docs: Update contrib docs ([#6974](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6974)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- docs: Add Lula to the OPA ecosystem ([#6902](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6902)) authored by @brandtkeller\r\n- docs: Add github action policy testing automation ([#6954](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6954)) authored by @oycyc\r\n- docs: Mention `http.send` in inter-query cache config docs ([#6953](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6953)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- docs+topdown: Fixing typos in built-in descriptions ([#6940](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6940)) authored by @msorens\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- build: Make it possible to build only wasm testcases ([#6920](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6920)) authored by @andreaTP\r\n- Dependency updates; notably:\r\n  - build(deps): bump github.com/containerd/containerd from 1.7.20 to 1.7.21\r\n  - build(deps): bump github.com/prometheus/client_golang from 1.19.1 to 1.20.2\r\n  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/net from 0.27.0 to 0.28.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/time from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.65.0 to 1.66.0\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "This release contains a mix of features, a new builtin function (`strings.count`), performance improvements, and bugfixes.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Change\r\n\r\n#### Request Body Size Limits\r\n\r\nOPA now automatically rejects very large requests ([#6868](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6868)) authored by @philipaconrad.\r\nRequests with a `Content-Length` larger than 128 MB uncompressed, and gzipped requests with payloads that decompress to\r\nlarger than 256 MB will be rejected, as part of hardening OPA against denial-of-service attacks. Previously, a large\r\nenough request could cause an OPA instance to run out of memory in low-memory sidecar deployment scenarios, just from\r\nattempting to read the request body into memory.\r\n\r\nThese changes allow improvements in memory usage for the OPA HTTP server, and help OPA deployments avoid some accidental out-of-memory situations.\r\n\r\nFor most users, no changes will be needed to continue using OPA. However, to control this behavior, two new configuration\r\nkeys are available: `server.decoding.max_length` and `server.decoding.gzip.max_length`. These control the max size in\r\nbytes to allow for an incoming request payload, and the maximum size in bytes to allow for a decompressed gzip request payload, respectively.\r\n\r\nHere's an example OPA configuration using the new keys:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# Set max request size to 64 MB and max gzip size (decompressed) to be 128 MB.\r\nserver:\r\n  decoding:\r\n    max_length: 67108864\r\n    gzip:\r\n      max_length: 134217728\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- topdown: New `strings.count` builtin which returns the number of non-overlapping instances of a substring in a string ([#6827](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6827)) authored by @Manish-Giri\r\n- format: Produce error when `--rego-v1`  formatted module has rule name conflicting with keyword ([#6833](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6833)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- topdown: Add cap to caches for regex and glob built-in functions ([#6828](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6828)) authored by @johanfylling. This fixes possible memory leaks where caches grow uncontrollably when large amounts of regexes or globs are generated or originate from the input document.\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n- repl: Add support for correctly loading bundle modules ([#6872](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6872)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- plugins/discovery: Allow un-registration of discovery listener ([#6851](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6851)) authored by @mjungsbluth. The discovery plugin allows OPA to register a bundle download status listener but previously did not offer a method to unregister that listener\r\n- plugins/logs: Reduce amount of work performed inside global lock in decision log plugin ([#6859](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6859)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- plugins/rest: Add a new client credential attribute to support Azure Workload Identity. This would allow workloads deployed on an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster to authenticate and access Azure cloud resources ([#6802](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6802)) authored by @ledbutter\r\n- cmd/inspect: Add ability for opa inspect to inspect a single file outside of any bundle ([#6873](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6873)) authored by @tjons\r\n- cmd+bundle: Add `--follow-symlinks` flag to the `opa build` command to allow users to build directories with symlinked files, and have the contents of those symlinked files included in the built bundle ([#6800](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6800)) authored by @tjons\r\n- server: Add missing handling in the server for the `explain=fails` query value ([#6886](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6886)) authored by @acamatcisco\r\n\r\n### Docs, Website, Ecosystem\r\n- docs: Update bundle section with an example of a manifest with `rego_version` and `file_rego_versions` attributes ([#6885](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6885)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- docs: Better link language SDKs to make them more discoverable ([#6866](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6866)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- ci: Add the OpenSSF Scorecard Github Action to help evaluate the OPA project's security posture ([#6848](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6848)) authored by @harshitasao\r\n- Dependency updates; notably:\r\n  - build(go): bump golang from 1.22.4 to 1.22.5\r\n  - build(deps): bump github.com/containerd/containerd from 1.7.18 to 1.7.20\r\n  - build(deps): bump golang.org/x/net from 0.26.0 to 0.27.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc from 1.64.0 to 1.65.0\r\n  - build(deps): bump go.opentelemetry.io modules ([#6847](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6847))\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> **_NOTES:_**\r\n>\r\n> * The minimum version of Go required to build the OPA module is **1.21**\r\n\r\nThis release contains a mix of features, a new builtin function (`json.marshal_with_options()`), performance improvements, and bugfixes.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Change\r\n\r\n#### Bootstrap configuration overrides Discovered configuration\r\n\r\nPreviously if Discovery was enabled, other features like bundle downloading and status reporting could not be configured manually.\r\nThe reason for this was to prevent OPAs being deployed that could not be controlled through discovery. It's possible that\r\nthe system serving the discovered config is unaware of all options locally available in OPA. Hence, we relax the configuration\r\ncheck when discovery is enabled so that the bootstrap configuration can contain plugin configurations. In case of conflicts,\r\nthe bootstrap configuration for plugins wins. These local configuration overrides from the bootstrap configuration are included\r\nin the Status API messages so that management systems can get visibility into the local overrides.\r\n\r\n**In general, the bootstrap configuration overrides the discovered configuration.** Previously this was not the case for all\r\nconfiguration fields. For example, if the discovered configuration changes the `labels` section, only labels that are\r\nadditional compared to the bootstrap configuration are used, all other changes are ignored. This implies labels in the\r\nbootstrap configuration override those in the discovered configuration. But for fields such as `default_decision`, `default_authorization_decision`,\r\n`nd_builtin_cache`, the discovered configuration would override the bootstrap configuration. Now the behavior is more consistent\r\nfor the entire configuration and helps to avoid accidental configuration errors. ([#5722](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5722)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n\r\n### Add `rego_version` attribute to the bundle manifest\r\n\r\nA new global `rego_version` attribute is added to the bundle manifest, to inform the OPA runtime about what Rego version (`v0`/`v1`) to\r\nuse while parsing/compiling contained Rego files. There is also a new `file_rego_versions` attribute which allows individual\r\nfiles to override the global Rego version specified by `rego_version`.\r\n\r\nWhen the version of the contained Rego is advertised by the bundle through this attribute, it is not required to run OPA with the\r\n`--v1-compatible` (or future `--v0-compatible`) flag in order to correctly parse, compile and evaluate the bundle's modules.\r\n\r\nA bundle's `rego_version` attribute takes precedence over any applied `--v1-compatible`/`--v0-compatible` flag.

The panic occurs when `opa build` was provided an entrypoint from both a CLI flag, and via entrypoint metadata annotation.

    "body": "v0.59.0\r\n\r\n\r\nThis release adds tooling to help prepare existing policies for the upcoming OPA 1.0 release.\r\nIt also contains a mix of improvements, bugfixes and security fixes for third-party libraries.\r\n\r\n> **_NOTES:_**\r\n>\r\n> * All published OPA images now run with a non-root uid/gid. The `uid:gid` is set to `1000:1000` for all images. As a result\r\n    there is no longer a need for the `-rootless` image variant and hence it will not be published as part of future releases.\r\n    This change is in line with container security best practices. OPA can still be run with root privileges by explicitly setting the user,\r\n    either with the `--user` argument for `docker run`, or by specifying the `securityContext` in the Kubernetes Pod specification.\r\n\r\n### Rego v1\r\n\r\nThe upcoming release of OPA 1.0, which will be released at a future date, will introduce breaking changes to the Rego language. Most notably:\r\n\r\n* the keywords that currently must be imported through `import future.keywords` into a module before use will be part of the Rego language by default, without the need to first import them.\r\n* the `if` keyword will be required before the body of a rule.\r\n* the `contains` keyword will be required when declaring a multi-value rule (partial set rule).\r\n* deprecated built-in functions will be removed.\r\n\r\nThis current release (`0.59.0`) introduces a new `--rego-v1` flag to the `opa fmt` and `opa check` commands to facilitate the transition of existing policies to be compatible with the 1.0 syntax.\r\n\r\nWhen used with `opa fmt`, the `--rego-v1` flag will format the module(s) according to the new Rego syntax in OPA 1.0. \r\nFormatted modules are compatible with both the current version of OPA and 1.0. \r\nModules using deprecated built-ins will terminate formatting with an error. Future versions of OPA will support rewriting applicable function calls with equivalent Rego compatible with 1.0. \r\n\r\nWhen used with `opa check`, the `--rego-v1` flag will check that the modules are compatible with both the current version of OPA and 1.0.\r\n\r\n#### Relevant Changes\r\n\r\n- cmd: Adding `--rego-v1` flag to `check` cmd ([#6429](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6429)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- cmd & format: Adding rego-v1 mode to `opa fmt` ([#6297](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6297)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- ast: Adding capability feature for the `rego.v1` import (#6375) (authored by @johanfylling)\r\n- ast: Skip if keyword requirement for default rule (`rego.v1`) ([#6356](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6356)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- rego.v1: Fixing erroneous missing value assignment error ([#6364](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6364)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- rego.v1: Improving support for rules with chained bodies ([#6370](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6370)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- ast: Add `rego.v1` import ([#6247](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6247)) introduced in OPA 0.58.0, authored by @johanfylling\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- ast: Adding `rule_head_refs` capabilities feature flag ([#6334](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6334)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- build: Remove rootless image variant ([#4295](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4295)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- discovery: Make status updates non blocking (#6345) ([#6343](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6343)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- plugins/rest: Masks X-AMZ-SECURITY-TOKEN header in decision logs ([#5848](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5848)) authored by @colinjlacy reported by @jwineinger\r\n- wasm: Fix re2 bug ([#6376](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6376)) authored by @srenatus reported by @sandhose\r\n- ast: Add ExcludeLocationFile JSON marshalling option ([#6398](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6398)) (authored by @anderseknert)\r\n- cmd: Add options to the filter to only load rego files ([#6317](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6317)) authored by @tjons\r\n- ast: Add minimum compatible version computation to compiler ([#6348](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6348)) authored by @tsandall \r\n- internal/planner: Insert general ref head objects starting from the leaves, not root.

    "body": "> **_NOTES:_**\r\n>\r\n> * All published OPA images now run with a non-root uid/gid. The `uid:gid` is set to `1000:1000` for all images. As a result\r\n    there is no longer a need for the `-rootless` image variant and hence it will not be published as part of future releases.\r\n    This change is in line with container security best practices. OPA can still be run with root privileges by explicitly setting the user,\r\n    either with the `--user` argument for `docker run`, or by specifying the `securityContext` in the Kubernetes Pod specification.\r\n\r\nThis release contains a mix of performance improvements, bugfixes and security fixes for third-party libraries.\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n- cmd/test: Display lines not covered if code coverage threshold not met in verbose reporting mode ([#2562](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2562)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- cmd/test: Don't round up test coverage calculation as it could lead to inaccurate code coverage results ([#6307](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6307)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- cmd/fmt: Don't format functions without a value to include `= true` as it is implied ([#6323](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6323)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- server: Remove deprecated partial query parameter from REST API.

    "body": "This release contains an updated Rego syntax to allow general references in rule heads, and a mix of new features and bugfixes.\r\n\r\n### Support for General References in Rule Heads\r\n\r\nIn OPA `0.56.0`, we introduced support for general references in rule heads as an experimental feature. \r\nIt has now graduated to a fully supported feature, and is no longer experimental. \r\n\r\nA general reference is a reference with variables at arbitrary locations. \r\nIn Rego, [partial rules](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#partial-rules) are used for generating sets and objects.\r\nIn previous versions of OPA, variables were only allowed in the very last position in the rule's reference. \r\nNow, Rego has been expanded to allow rules to be declared with general references in their head, with variables at arbitrary locations. \r\nThis allows for generating nested dynamic object structures:\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage example\r\n\r\nimport future.keywords\r\n\r\n# Converting a flat list of users to a mapping by \"role\" and then \"id\".\r\nusers_by_role[role][id] := user if {\r\n    some user in data.users\r\n    id := user.id\r\n    role := user.role\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Explicit \"admin\" key override to the above mapping.\r\nusers_by_role.admin[id] := user if {\r\n    some user in data.admins\r\n    id := user.id\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Leaf entries can be multi-value.\r\nusers_by_country[country] contains user.id if {\r\n    some user in data.users\r\n    country := user.country\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#variables-in-rule-head-references) for more information.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @johanfylling.\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- ast/runtime: Extend type checking for authz policies ([#6213](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6213)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- server: Add test case for bundle update - query API handler scenario ([#4792](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4792)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- ast: Accept short-form else bodies ([#6157](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6157)) authored by @Ronnie-personal\r\n- plugins: Surface AWS authentication error details ([#6232](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6232)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- topdown: Builtin function to parse uuid with google/uuid library ([#6173](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6173)) authored by @Od1nB\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- ast: Add location to single entry rule head ref ([#6199](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6199)) authored by @Ronnie-personal\r\n- ast: Add option to marshal location text ([#6213](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6213)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- types: New algorithm for (Any).Union + new benchmarks ([#6228](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6228)) authored by @philipaconrad\r\n- Updates to documentation and website authored by @charlieegan3\r\n  - docs: Link to expressing or post (#6236) (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n  - docs: Use links on support page (#6249) (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- Dependency updates; notably:\r\n  - golang from 1.21 to 1.21.1\r\n  - golang.org/x/net from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0\r\n  - google.golang.org/grpc from 1.57.0 to 1.58.2\r\n  - github.com/containerd/containerd from 1.7.4 to 1.7.6\r\n \r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nGO SDK: the `ast.JSONOptions` struct has changed location to `ast.json.Options`.",

    "body": "This release contains a mix of new features, bugfixes and a new builtin function.\r\n\r\n### Support for General References in Rule Heads (Experimental)\r\n\r\nA new experimental feature in OPA is support for general refs in rule heads. Where a general ref is a reference with variables at arbitrary locations.\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage example\r\n\r\nimport future.keywords\r\n\r\n# Converting a flat list of users to a mapping by \"role\" and then \"id\".\r\nusers_by_role[role][id] := user if {\r\n    some user in data.users\r\n    id := user.id\r\n    role := user.role\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Explicit \"admin\" key override to the above mapping.\r\nusers_by_role.admin[id] := user if {\r\n    some user in data.admins\r\n    id := user.id\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Leaf entries can be multi-value.\r\nusers_by_country[country] contains user.id if {\r\n    some user in data.users\r\n    country := user.country\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGeneral refs are currently not supported by the OPA planner, making this feature unsupported for Wasm and IR.\r\n\r\nNote: this feature is disabled by default, and needs to be enabled by setting the `EXPERIMENTAL_GENERAL_RULE_REFS` environment variable (once the feature is complete - supports Wasm and IR - this requirement will be dropped).\r\n\r\nAuthored by @johanfylling.\r\n\r\n### New Built-In Function: `numbers.range_step`\r\n\r\nSimilar to the `numbers.range` built-in function, `numbers.range_step` returns an array of numbers in a given range. The new built-in function also allows you to control the _step between each entry_.\r\n\r\nSee [the documentation on the new built-in](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.56.0/policy-reference/#builtin-numbers-numbersrange_step)\r\nfor all the details.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @sspaink.\r\n\r\n### New Ecosystem page on The Website\r\n\r\nThe OPA Ecosystem of related integrations has been refreshed and moved to a more prominent location on [the website](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/ecosystem/). \r\n\r\nIf you're interested to add any new integrations you've been working on, please see the [docs here](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/tree/main/docs#opa-ecosystem) (updates to existing integrations are very welcome too!).\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- ast: Update strict error check message for unused args ([#6125](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6125)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- ast: Remove unnecessary nil check ([#6155](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6155)) authored by @Juneezee\r\n- cmd: Make `opa test -z` fail with failing tests ([#6126](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6126)) authored by @fdaguin\r\n- cmd: Fix `opa test` `--ignore` when used together with `--bundle` ([#6185](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6185)) authored by @joaobrandt\r\n- cmd: Adding `--fail-non-empty` flag to `opa exec` ([#6153](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6153)) authored by @Ronnie-personal\r\n- download: Add `opa_no_oci` flag to build without containerd ([#6159](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6159)) authored by @slonka\r\n- download: Remove not required basedir for oci bundles & add test to verify signature verification ([#6145](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6145)) authored by @gitu\r\n- fmt: Trim trailing whitespace in comments ([#6161](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6161)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- fmt: Remove dedup comment function in opa fmt ([#6165](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6165)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n- runtime: Always read .tar.gz file provided in argument as a bundle ([#5879](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5879)) authored by @yogisinha\r\n- server/authorizer: Inline readBody ([#6156](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6156)) authored by @srenatus\r\n- test: Bind test server to localhost interface ([#6162](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6162)) authored by @anderseknert\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- ast: Including \"child\" rules when fetching rules by ref ([#6182](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6182)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- ast: Making partial object key rules contribute to dynamic portion of object type ([#6138](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6138)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- rego: Expose PrepareOption, add BuiltinFuncs ([#6188](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6188)) authored by @srenatus\r\n- topdown: Support force cache even when server doesn't set the Date header ([#6175](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6175)) authored by @c2zwdjnlcg\r\n- topdown: Partial-eval for partial object/set ref head rules ([#6094](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6094)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- Updates to Documentation and Website (authored by: @anderseknert, @ashutosh-narkar, @atkrad, @charlieegan3, @hmoazzem, @johndbro1, @Pushkarm029, @srenatus and @testwill)\r\n- Dependency updates; notably:\r\n  - golang: from 1.20.6 to 1.21 (authored by @ashutosh-narkar amd @srenatus)\r\n  - golang.org/x/net from 0.12.0 to 0.14.0\r\n  - google.golang.org/grpc from 1.56.2 to 1.57.0\r\n  - oras.land/oras-go/v2 from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0\r\n  - Replace ghodss/yaml with sigs.k8s.io/yaml ([#6195](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6195)) authored by @mrueg\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\nSince its introduction in 0.34.0, the `--exit-zero-on-skipped` option always made the `opa test` command return an exit code 0. When used, it now returns the exit code 0 only if no failed tests were found.\r\n\r\nTest runs on existing projects using `--exit-zero-on-skipped` will fail if any failed tests were inhibited by this behavior.",

    "body": "> **_NOTES:_**\r\n>\r\n> * All published OPA images now run with a non-root uid/gid. The `uid:gid` is set to `1000:1000` for all images. As a result\r\n> there is no longer a need for the `-rootless` image variant and hence it will be not be published as part of future releases.\r\n> This change is in line with container security best practices. OPA can still be run with root privileges by explicitly setting the user,\r\n> either with the `--user` argument for `docker run`, or by specifying the `securityContext` in the Kubernetes Pod specification.\r\n>\r\n> * The minimum version of Go required to build the OPA module is **1.19**\r\n\r\nThis release contains a mix of new features, bugfixes and a new builtin function.\r\n\r\n### Honor `default` keyword on functions\r\n\r\nPreviously if a function was defined with a `default` value, OPA would ignore it. Now the `default` function is honored\r\nif all functions with the same name are undefined. For example,\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage example\r\n\r\ndefault clamp_positive(_) := 0\r\n\r\nclamp_positive(x) = x {\r\n    x > 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ opa eval -d example.rego 'data.example.clamp_positive(1)' -f pretty\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ opa eval -d example.rego 'data.example.clamp_positive(-1)' -f pretty\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value of a `default` function follows the same conditions as that of a `default` rule. In addition, a `default`\r\nfunction satisfies the following properties:\r\n\r\n- same arity as other functions with the same name\r\n- arguments should only be plain variables ie. no composite values\r\n- argument names should not be repeated\r\n\r\n> **_NOTE:_**  \r\n> \r\n> `default` functions used to be previously ignored. If existing policies contain `default` functions, ensure that they conform\r\n> to the properties mentioned above. Otherwise, those policies will fail to evaluate.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @ashutosh-narkar.\r\n\r\n### New Built-In Function: crypto.parse_private_keys\r\n\r\n`crypto.parse_private_keys` returns zero or more private keys from the given encoded string containing DER certificate data.\r\nIf the input contains a list of one or more concatenated PEM blocks, then the built-in will output the parsed private keys\r\nrepresented as objects.\r\n\r\nSee [the documentation on the new built-in](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.55.0/policy-reference/#builtin-crypto-cryptoparse_private_keys)\r\nfor all the details.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @volck.\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- plugins/rest: Add AWS KMS support for OAuth2 Client Credentials JWT authentication ([#5942](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5942)) authored by @prasanthu\r\n- sdk: Update input object to conform to the format expected by decision log masking ([#6090](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6090)) authored by @epaulson10\r\n- sdk: Add option for specifying decision ID to SDK. Users can use this to control the ID that gets included in the decision logs ([#6101](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6101)) authored by @brianchhun-chime\r\n- cmd: Add `discard` output format to `opa eval` which discards the result while still showing the output of eval flags like `--profile` ([#6103](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6103)) authored by @26tanishabanik\r\n- Make rootless deprecation messages more explicit as all published OPA images now run with non-root uid/gid ([#6091](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6091)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- download/oci: Add support for Docker Registry v2 authentication scheme ([#6045](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6045)) authored by @gitu and @DerGut\r\n- plugins/discovery: Ensure discovery plugin doesn't erase its own config on the plugin manager ([#6070](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6070)) authored by @blacksails\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- ast: Add `WithRoots` compiler option that allows callers to set the roots to include in the output bundle manifest ([#6088](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6088)) authored by @kubaj\r\n- rego: Parse store modules iff modules set on the Rego object. This change assumes that while using the Rego package, the compiler and store are kept in-sync, and thereby attempts to avoid a race during the compilation process ([#6081](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6081)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\n\r\n- docs/envoy: Update the standalone Envoy tutorial to use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), updated Envoy version etc. ([#6105](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6105)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n\r\n### Website + Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Ecosystem:\r\n  - Carbonetes BrainIAC ([#6073](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6073)) authored by @jaysonsantos05\r\n\r\n- Website:\r\n  - Reorganize relevant doc sections and OPA Ecosystem projects to have a closer integration between them ([#6064](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/6064)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n- chore: Update comments on some exported functions and clean up instances where the same package was imported multiple times (authored by @testwill)\r\n- Fix issue in the OPA release patch scripts related to `CRLF` line terminations in the patch output ([#6069](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6069)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- Dependency bumps, notably:\r\n  - golang from 1.20.5 to 1.20.6\r\n  - oras.land/oras-go/v2 from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1\r\n  - google.golang.org/grpc from 1.56.1 to 1.56.2\r\n  - github.com/containerd/containerd from 1.6.19 to 1.7.2\r\n  - golang.org/x/net from 0.11.0 to 0.12.0\r\n  - go.uber.org/automaxprocs from 1.5.2 to 1.5.3\r\n  - go.opentelemetry.io/otel from v1.14.0 to v1.16.0 ([#6062](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/6062)) authored by @srenatus with feedback from @ghaskins and @zregvart",

    "body": "This is a bug fix release addressing the following issues:\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n- plugins/logs: Previously while passing the decision log plugins's status to the Status API, the plugin held the mutex while a status upload was in process. This had the potential to block new decisions from being written to the plugin's buffer. To avoid this situation, a local copy of plugin's status is created ([#5966](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5966)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- download: Public docker repositories require an authorization handshake where the client needs to respond to challenges marked by the `WWW-Authenticate` header of a `401 Unauthorized` response. Errors were returned when downloading a public image as it was assumed that authorization is not necessary for public repositories. This fix addresses this issue by challenging any `401 Unauthorized` responses by passing it to the docker.Authorizer ([#5902](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5902)) authored by @DerGut\r\n- `opa fmt`: Fix panic encountered while processing policies with comprehensions written on multiple lines with comments in these lines ([#5798](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5798)) authored by @Trolloldem\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n- built-in function `object.subset`: Fix an issue in `object.subset` related to incorrect results being generated when arrays are provided as an input ([#5968](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5968)) authored by @DCRUNNN\r\n- planner: Fix the optimization check for overlapping ref rules ([#5964](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5964)) authored by @srenatus",

    "body": "This release contains some enhancements, bugfixes, and a new builtin function.\r\n\r\n### Allow Adding Labels via Discovery\r\n\r\nPreviously OPA did not allow any updates to the labels provided in the boot configuration via the discovered (ie. service)\r\nconfig. This was done to avoid breaking the discovery configuration. But there are use cases where labels can serve as a convenient\r\nway to pass information that could be used in policies, status updates or decision logs. This change allows\r\nadditional labels to be configured in the service config which are then made available during runtime.\r\n\r\nSee [the Discovery documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.52.0/management-discovery/#limitations) for more details.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @mjungsbluth.\r\n\r\n### New Built-In Function: crypto.hmac.equal\r\n\r\n`crypto.hmac.equal` provides a convenient way to compare hashes generated by the MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 hashing algorithms.\r\n\r\nBelow is a real world example of how this built-in function can be utilized. Imagine our server is registered as a\r\nGitHub webhook which subscribes to certain events on GitHub.com. Now we want to limit requests to those coming from GitHub.\r\nOne of the ways to do that is to first set up a secret token and validate the information. Once we create the token on GitHub,\r\nwe'll set up an environment variable that stores this token and makes it available to OPA via the `opa.runtime` built-in.\r\nIn the case of GitHub webhooks the validation is done by comparing the hash signature received in the `X-Hub-Signature-256`\r\nheader and calculating a hash using the secret token and payload body. The `check_signature` rule implements this logic.\r\n\r\n```rego\r\npackage example\r\n\r\nimport input.attributes.request.http as http_request\r\n\r\nallow {\r\n    http_request.method == \"POST\"\r\n    input.parsed_path = [\"workflows\", \"github\", \"webhooks\"]\r\n    check_signature\r\n}\r\n\r\ncheck_signature {\r\n    secret_key := opa.runtime().env.GITHUB_SECRET_KEY\r\n    hash_body := crypto.hmac.sha256(http_request.raw_body, secret_key)\r\n    expected_signature := concat(\"\", [\"sha256=\", hash_body])\r\n    header_signature = http_request.headers[\"X-Hub-Signature-256\"]\r\n    crypto.hmac.equal(header_signature, expected_signature)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [the documentation on the new built-in](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.52.0/policy-reference/#builtin-crypto-cryptohmacequal) for all the details.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @sandokandias.\r\n\r\n### Extend Authentication Methods Supported by OCI Downloader\r\n\r\nPreviously the OCI Downloader had support for only three types of authentication methods, namely `Client TLS Certificates`,\r\n`Basic Authentication` and `Bearer Token`. This change adds support for other authentication methods such as [AWS Signature](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.52.0/configuration/#aws-signature),\r\n[GCP Metadata Token](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.52.0/configuration/#gcp-metadata-token). See [the documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.52.0/configuration/#using-private-image-from-oci-repositories)\r\nfor more details.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @DerGut.\r\n\r\n### Update Profiler Output With Number of Generated Expressions\r\n\r\nThe number of EVAL/REDO counts in the profile result are sometimes difficult to understand. This is mainly due to the\r\nfact that the compiler rewrites expressions and assigns the same location to each generated expression and the profiler\r\nkeys the counters by the location. To provide more clarity, the profile output now includes the number of generated\r\nexpressions for each given expression thereby helping to better understand the result and also how the evaluation works.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the updated profiler output with the new `NUM GEN EXPR` column:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n+----------+----------+----------+--------------+-------------+\r\n|   TIME   | NUM EVAL | NUM REDO | NUM GEN EXPR |  LOCATION   |\r\n+----------+----------+----------+--------------+-------------+\r\n| 20.291\u00b5s | 3        | 3        | 3            | test.rego:7 |\r\n| 1\u00b5s      | 1        | 1        | 1            | test.rego:6 |\r\n| 2.333\u00b5s  | 1        | 1        | 1            | test.rego:5 |\r\n| 6.333\u00b5s  | 1        | 1        | 1            | test.rego:4 |\r\n| 84.75\u00b5s  | 1        | 1        | 1            | data        |\r\n+----------+----------+----------+--------------+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [the Profiling documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/v0.52.0/policy-performance/#profiling) for more details.\r\n\r\nAuthored by @ashutosh-narkar.\r\n\r\n### Runtime, Tooling, SDK\r\n\r\n- bundle: Add ability to load bundles from an arbitrary filesystem ([#5833](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5833)) authored by @kjothen\r\n- server: Add a note to explicitly point out if OPA binds to the 0.0.0.0 interface on server initialization ([#5090](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5090)) authored by @Parsifal-M\r\n- Include trace and span identifier in decision logs to help with correlating logs and trace data ([#5230](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5230)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- ast: Disallow partial object rules to have other partial object rule within their immediate extent ([#5855](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5855)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- ast: Disallow multi-value rules to have other rules in their extent ([#5813](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5813)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- ast: Set result of groundness check on indexer's AllRules func so that rule evaluation for complete rules is not skipped ([#5857](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5857)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar\r\n- rego: Fix duplicate text in error message during module parsing ([#5837](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5837)) authored by @TzlilSwimmer123\r\n- planner: Fix bugs that have an impact on IR ([#5829](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5829)) and Wasm usage ([#5839](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5839)) authored by @srenatus\r\n- ast: Include information about the location of rule value and reference in the AST's JSON representation based on the provided custom parsing options ([#5790](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5790)) authored by @Trolloldem\r\n- ast: Fix issue with unset annotation data when custom parsing options provided ([#5826](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5826)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\n\r\n- docs/rest-api: Update Compile API docs to include some use-cases ([#5858](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5858)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n- docs/extensions: Add Nondeterministic field to the Rego object initialization in the code example for the Custom Built-in Function section ([#5861](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5861)) (authored by @RmStorm)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Website + Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Ecosystem:\r\n  - Reposaur ([#5854](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5854)) authored by @charlieegan3\r\n  - Update logo for Torque integration ([#5810](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5810)) authored by @shirabendor-quali\r\n\r\n- Website:\r\n  - Reorganize the `MISCELLANEOUS` section to improve content navigation ([#4614](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4614)) authored by @lakhanjindam\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- Dependency bumps, notably:\r\n  - golang from 1.20.2 to 1.20.3\r\n  - golang.org/x/net from 0.8.0 to 0.9.0\r\n  - github.com/prometheus/client_golang from 1.14.0 to 1.15.0",

    "body": "This release contains improvements to monitoring and an assortment of fixes and improvements.\r\n\r\n### Monitoring\r\n\r\n#### Surface unauthorized request count from OPA HTTP API authz handler via Status API\r\n\r\nCurrently when OPA's HTTP server rejects requests per the [authz policy](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization), this is not accounted for via the management APIs. This change adds that count in the metric registry that is part of the Status API for more visibility.\r\n\r\n([#3378](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/3378)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar.\r\n\r\n#### Surface more decision log errors via Status API \r\n\r\nPreviously in [5732](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5732), we updated the decision log plugin to surface errors via the Status API. However, in that change certain events like encoder errors and log drops due to buffer size limits had no metrics associated with them. This change adds more metrics for these events so that they can be surfaced via the Status API.\r\n\r\n([#5637](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5637)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar.\r\n\r\n#### Include truncated HTTP response in logs \r\n\r\nThis change updates the client debug log to include the full HTTP response in case of non-200 status codes. Recording the response in the logs can help to provide more information to debug error scenarios.\r\n\r\n([#2961](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/2961)) authored by @ashutosh-narkar reported by @gshively11.\r\n\r\n### Topdown and Rego\r\n\r\n- Wasm: Add native support for `object.union_n` built-in function (authored by @Azanul)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- ast: Properly set the reported location of unused variables in strict-mode errors. ([#5662](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5662)) authored by @boranx\r\n- fmt: report wrong arity for built-in functions. ([#5646](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5646)) authored by @Trolloldem\r\n- topdown: http.send(): Ensuring intra-query caching consistency. ([#5736](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5736)) authored by @johanfylling\r\n- Performance improvements to decision logging.\r\n  Specifically, by removing superfluous json encoding roundtrip and double work in AST conversion of to-be-logged events. (authored by @srenatus)\r\n\r\n### Docs, Website, and Ecosystem\r\n\r\n- Fix typo in documentation (authored by @eternaltyro)\r\n- Update TLS authentication docs (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- Clarification in docs about checksums of Windows executables (authored by @Ronnie-personal)\r\n- docs: Small fix to context placement in integration (authored by @craigpastro)\r\n- docs/website: Fix floating navbar anchor issue ([5774](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5774)) authored by @charlieegan3 reported by @kristiansvalland\r\n  \r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- Update -debug images to use Chainguard images ([5544](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/5544)) (authored by @charlieegan3)\r\n- Various third-party dependencies were updated.",
