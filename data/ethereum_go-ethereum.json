    "body": "\ud83d\udea7  **Note: we are investigating an issue with this release that affects archive nodes (--gcmode=archive).\r\n If you are running Geth in this mode, please hold off upgrading.** \ud83d\udea7 \r\n\r\nThis is a feature release, with two exciting upgrades:\r\n\r\n- Log filtering in Geth receives a huge performance upgrade with the introduction of our new 'filtermaps' index. Unlike the previous 'bloombits' index, query performance no longer suffers as the density of logs in a block increases. The new index design is also a step towards a future where filtering results can be proven by the server. See [the PR](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31079) and associated design documents for more information.\r\n\r\n  In practical terms, the new index is a bit larger than the old one. As before, you can choose the amount of historical blocks to be indexed using the `--history.logs` command-line flag. We have adjusted the default value of this flag to cover one year of history, and the resulting index has a size of ~10GB for Ethereum mainnnet. Indexing of the entire chain with `--history.logs=0` will take up ~61GB.\r\n\r\n  Once the index is built, searches will be fast, but note that querying outside of the indexed block range will fall back to a very slow unindexed search. We will continue optimizing log searches in future releases, and welcome your feedback and bug reports in this area. (#31065, #31079, #31080, #31081, #31419, #31429, #31450, #31463, #31455)\r\n\r\n- [abigen v2](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings-v2) is finally here. abigen is a tool for creating Go bindings for Solidity contracts. In v1, the generated bindings presented an API for sending transactions, filtering logs, and performing read-only calls as Go methods on the contract object. In the new version, we have updated the interface of the generated code to focus purely on encoding and decoding ABI payloads. Generic helper functions are provided in a library package to enable the same interactions as before, but you can also use your own custom method of signing & sending transactions. Generated bindings are also significantly smaller. (#31379)\r\n\r\nOther changes in this release:\r\n\r\n#### RPC\r\n\r\n- A regression in `eth_sendRawTransaction` - where transactions with too-low nonce would be accepted by the API - has been fixed. (#31473)\r\n- `eth_call`/`estimateGas` RPC methods will now always return error code 3 for reverts. It previously only returned this code when the EVM produced revert data. (#31456)\r\n- `eth_simulateV1` now returns a correct logs bloom value in the simulated block (#31411)\r\n- `eth_simulateV1` supports block overrides for the beacon root and withdrawals (#31304)\r\n- `debug_traceCall`: the `movePrecompileTo` override feature should now work correctly (#31348)\r\n- `debug_traceCall` and other related RPC methods now hex-encode the EVM return value. **This is a breaking change.** (#31216, #31445)\r\n- `ethclient` has a new method `EstimateGasAtBlock` (#27508)\r\n\r\n#### Geth\r\n\r\n- Support for the [Hoodi testnet](https://github.com/eth-clients/hoodi) has been added. (#31406)\r\n- The beacon chain light client has been updated to support the Electra fork. (#31243, #31470)\r\n- `geth import` now properly handles Ctrl-C interrupts (#31360)\r\n- `geth --dev` mode will now pre-fund all precompile accounts supported by the Pectra upgrade (#31342)\r\n- `geth --dev` now respects the `--miner.pending.feeRecipient` flag (#31316)\r\n\r\n#### Core library\r\n\r\n- The performance of transaction signature validation has improved significantly (#31242, #31258, #31434)\r\n- The transaction pool has seen some correctness and performance improvements. (#31430, #31307, #31332)\r\n- We have added a lot of preliminary changes for History Expiry (EIP-4444). There shouldn't be any user-facing consequences of these just yet, just reporting it here since this area was a big focus this cycle. (#31424, #31355, #31362, #31383, #31365, #31117, #31356, #31384, #31393)\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.15.6 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/183?closed=1)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs with all our previous releases, you can find the:\r\n\r\n- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).\r\n- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).\r\n- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\r\n- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).\r\n",

    "body": "Oh look, another hotfix release! We are issuing this Geth release to correct the predefined fork configuration of the Holesky and Sepolia testnets. The deposit contract address was missing in the configuration for these networks, causing a chain validation failure.\r\n\r\nThis issue was discovered on the Holesky network after it had already forked into Pectra (Prague). As a reminder, the Sepolia network will fork to Pectra at slot 7118848 (Wed, Mar 5 at 07:29:36 UTC). You need to upgrade to Geth v1.15.3 until then in order to use the testnet after the fork.\r\n\r\nAll changes in this release:\r\n\r\n- Deposit contract addresses are now defined in testnet fork configuration. (#31247)\r\n- The `eth_simulateV1` RPC method was improved to match regular block processing semantics. (#31176, #31122)\r\n- A peer-finding issue with discovery v5 is fixed in this release. (#31251)\r\n- An invalid `--discovery.dns` flag value will now cause an error at Geth startup. (#31233)\r\n- Geth `--dev` mode can now handle custom genesis configs with forks older than the latest. (#31084)\r\n- The EVM assembler/disassembler (package `core/asm`) has been removed. (#31211)\r\n- Encoding of nested byte arrays in EIP-712 signature processing was fixed. (#31049)\r\n- The cloudflare-go dependency has been updated to resolve a dependabot warning. (#31240)\r\n- This release is built with Go 1.24.0 (#31159)\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.15.3 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/180?closed=1)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs with all our previous releases, you can find the:\r\n\r\n- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).\r\n- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).\r\n- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\r\n- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).\r\n",

    "body": "We are proud to announce the Geth 1.15.0 release.\r\n\r\nThis release contains some breaking changes to the database. Downgrading to v1.14.x requires re-syncing the chain.\r\n\r\n### Prague Fork\r\n\r\nAs of this release, Geth implements the Prague fork specifications up to devnet-6.\r\n\r\n- [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537) - BLS12-381 curve operations - has seen some updates. ([#30978](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30978))\r\n- [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) - Increase calldata cost - was implemented this cycle. ([#30946](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30946))\r\n- [EIP-7685](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685) - Execution layer requests - support was updated. ([#30670](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30670), [#30829](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30829), [#31103](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31103), [#31010](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31010), [#31071](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31071), [#30938](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30938), [#31102](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31102))\r\n- [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685) - Set EOA account code - was implemented this cycle. Note Geth does not support EIP-7702 transactions in the txpool just yet. ([#30078](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30078), [#30935](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30935), [#30936](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30936), [#31054](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31054), [#31032](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31032), [#30933](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30933), [#30982](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30982), [#31089](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31089), [#30926](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30926))\r\n- [EIP-7840](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840) - Blob schedule in EL config - was implemented this cycle. ([#31002](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31002), [#31101](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31101), [#31128](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31128))\r\n\r\n### Command changes\r\n\r\n- The `evm` command has seen lots of updates, improving its command-line interface and internals. ([#30633](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30633), [#30849](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30849), [#30806](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30806), [#30927](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30927), [#30780](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30780), [#30854](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30854), [#31055](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31055), [#30805](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30805), [#30804](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30804), )\r\n- Geth metrics can now be enabled via the TOML config file. This used to require the `--metrics` flag. ([#30814](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30814))\r\n- Similarly, you can now set the NAT traversal method (`--nat` flag) with the config file. ([#31041](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31041))\r\n- The `geth --trace` flag is now called `--go-execution-trace` to avoid confusion with EVM tracing. ([#30846](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30846))\r\n- The `bootnode` utility has been removed. ([#30813](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30813))\r\n\r\n### RPC & Tracing\r\n\r\n- The live tracing Go API has been updated with new hooks and optional EVM revert tracking. See the [tracing API changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/tracing/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. ([#30441](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30441), [#30786](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30786), [#30830](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30830), [#30784](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30784), [#31007](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31007))\r\n- RPC method `eth_estimateGas` now supports block overrides like `eth_call`. ([#30695](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30695))\r\n- RPC method `eth_simulateV1` now advances the timestamp by 12 seconds per block. ([#30981](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30981))\r\n- Package `accounts/abi` now supports unpacking Solidity error types. ([#30738](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30738))\r\n- Package `accounts/abi/bind` has new functions `WaitMinedHash`, `WaitDeployedHash`. ([#30079](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30079))\r\n- Package `accounts/usbwallet` was updated to support new Ledger firmware and the Ledger Flex device. ([#31004](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31004))\r\n- In package `ethclient/simulated`, a bug was fixed where transactions couldn't be sent after `Rollback` of the simulated chain. ([#31020](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31020))\r\n- The struct logger reports the EVM revert reason correctly again. ([#31013](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31013))\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a new database schema version. **A downgrade to v1.14.x requires a resync.**\r\n\r\n- The 'total difficulty' of the chain is no longer stored in the database. ([#30744](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30744))\r\n- The ancient store employs a new strategy for avoiding fsync on each update. This change should improve block import latency on some systems. ([#30392](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30392))\r\n- Reverse state diffs use a new encoding for future compatibility with the Verkle Tree. ([#30107](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30107), [#31060](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31060))\r\n- Internal handling of the SELFDESTRUCT operation has been simplified. This is possible since classic selfdestruct is no longer supported by the EVM after the Cancun fork. ([#30752](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30752), [#30802](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30802))\r\n- Work towards a re-implementation of the state snapshot system is ongoing. ([#30643](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30643), [#30650](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30650), [#30654](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30654))\r\n- Work on the Verkle Tree integration is also progressing. ([#31036](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31036), [#30856](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30856), [#30907](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30907), [#31097](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31097))\r\n\r\n### Core Library & Networking\r\n\r\n- The fix for [CVE-2025-24883](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-q26p-9cq4-7fc2) (recent v1.14.13 hotfix release) is also in v1.15.0 ([#31100](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31100)).\r\n- The transaction pool's notion of \"locals\" has been changed. This is a breaking change in some ways, and requires some explanation. Geth used to accept transactions at any fee level via RPC, storing them into the node's pool, and marking the sender as \"local\". When creating a new block (or the pending block), it would choose \"local\" transactions first. Finally, Geth tracks \"local\" transactions in a persistent journal file, and restores them on startup. The effect of all this is that once you had sent a transaction to Geth via RPC, it would keep prioritizing the sender account and its transactions (even ones received through p2p).\r\n\r\n  In Geth v1.15, we are changing this model to a different one. When receiving a transaction via RPC, it is stored into the pool like any other transaction, but it is also inserted into a separate \"locals tracker\" that keeps reinjecting the tx into the main pool periodically. When building a block, Geth no longer prefers the txpool locals, but you can configure a set of addresses that should get priority using the `--txpool.locals` CLI flag. ([#30559](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30559), [#31127](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31127))\r\n- For static nodes (from configuration or RPC `admin_addPeer`), the node URL can contain a DNS name. Geth will now resolve these names when attempting to connect to the peer, instead of at configuration parsing time. This is useful for setting up testing networks in Docker or Kubernetes where the IP address of a node might not be known ahead of time. ([#30822](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30822))\r\n- Geth can now use the STUN protocol to figure out its own IP. There is a built-in list of public servers, or you can specify your own. Use `--nat=stun` to enable. ([#31064](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31064))\r\n- Some minor bugs in the p2p protocol implementation got fixed. ([#30855](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30855), [#30918](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30918))\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- This release is built with Go 1.23.6 ([#31130](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31130))\r\n- The 'toolchain' line has been removed from go.mod ([#31057](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31057))\r\n- go-ethereum library functionality should now build and run on wasip1 ([#31090](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/31090))\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.15.0 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/177?closed=1)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs with all our previous releases, you can find the:\r\n\r\n- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).\r\n- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).\r\n- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\r\n- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).\r\n",

In particular; changes in tracing and account management, optimizations in database, trie and evm, and, as always bugfixes. \r\n\r\nThis release removes the `personal` RPC namespace. It was already previously deprecated, and has not been accessible by default for nearly two years. We also removed the `--unlock` command-line parameter, with a view towards removing key/account management from the `geth` binary.\r\n\r\n- Key management:\r\n  - Remove `--unlock` command line flag from `geth` ([#30737](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30737))\r\n  - Remove `personal` RPC namespace ([#30704](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30704))\r\n- Builds:\r\n  - RISC-V docker images ([#30739](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30739))\r\n  - ppa-builds for ubuntu `24.10` ([#30580](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30580))\r\n- Tracing:\r\n  - invoke OnCodeChange-hook on selfdestruct ([#30686](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30686), [#30497](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30497))\r\n  - improvements to `flatCallTracer` ([#30539](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30539))\r\n  - invoke tx-end hook in runtime helpers ([#30711](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30711))\r\n  - `disableCode` and `disableStorage` options for `prestateTracer` ([#30648](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30648))\r\n  - tracing of system calls ([#30666](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30666))\r\n  - Change to how chainconfig is passed to tracers (**breaking change**) ([#30540](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30540))\r\n  - add `GetTransientState` method to StateDB interface ([#30531](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30531))\r\n- Signing:\r\n  - improved support for EIP-712 array types ([#30620](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30620))\r\n  - non-legacy transactions support for ledger wallets ([#30180](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30180))\r\n- Bugfixes:\r\n  - Set basefee for `AccessList` based on given block, not chain tip ([#30538](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30538))\r\n  - Multiple issues in benchmarks  ([#30667](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30667))\r\n  - Fix bug with resolving a payload ([#30615](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30615))\r\n- Database optimizations\r\n  - Run pebble in non-sync mode ([#30573](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30573), [#29792](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29792)).

It broke the blob pool, please do not use it.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a maintenance release, but also introduces support for the new multicall spec, which is a much anticipated feature providing a `eth_simulateV1` call, that takes a list of blocks and executes them as if calling multiple `eth_call`s sequentially. It accepts optional state and precompile overrides, as well as transfer log events. This release also ships with improved verkle support.\r\n\r\n## Command line\r\n\r\n* Remove Goerli flag and config (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30289)\r\n\r\n## Pectra\r\n\r\n* Implement [EIP-6110: Supply validator deposits on chain](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6110) (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29431)\r\n* Implement [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935) (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29465)\r\n\r\n## Core\r\n\r\n* Refactorings in the internal journaling (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28880)\r\n* Fix a flaw in which the system halts if snapshot generation is stopped while it's not running (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30040)\r\n* Fix potential out-of-bound issue in mempool (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30430)\r\n* Add state reader abstraction (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29761)\r\n\r\n## Txpool\r\n\r\n* Fetch transactions from a peer in the order they were announced in order to minimize nonce gap, causing blob txs to rejected. A special rule is applied to blob transactions: they are retrieved from the network upon reception of the announcement, as blob transactions are never broadcast over the p2p network (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30125)\r\n\r\n## Networking\r\n\r\n* Add support for quic entry in ENR (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30283)\r\n* fix Write method in metered connection (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30355)\r\n* Enable discv5 by default (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30327)\r\n* Proper handling for count=0 requests (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30305)\r\n* Fix permissions for cloudflare deploy (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30326)\r\n* Dial nodes from discv5 (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30302)\r\n \r\n## RPC / tracing\r\n\r\n* support for `eth_simulateV1`, which allows for the simulation a chain of blocks or simply a processing a sequence of eth_calls in one go. It is the implementation of the latest [multicall spec](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/484) (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27720)\r\n* Add timeout to `Client.Unsubscribe` (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30318)\r\n* Add coinbase addr to js tracing context (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30231)\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n* Handle ABIs with `contract` type parameters (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30315)\r\n* Support fixed-size arrays in eip-712 txs (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30175)\r\n* Fix txpool deadlock in `--dev` mode (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30264)\r\n* Use post-interop verkle costs (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30409, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30357)\r\n* Verkle witness builder (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30129)\r\n \r\n## Build\r\n\r\n* Work towards [reproducible builds](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/28987) (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30344, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30342, [#30346](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30346), [#30325](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30325), [#30321](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30321), [#30320](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30320), [#29723](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29723))\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/v1.14.8...v1.14.9\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth [1.14.9 release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/172?closed=1).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs with all our previous releases, you can find the:\r\n\r\n- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).\r\n- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).\r\n- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\r\n- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).\r\n",

([#30203](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30203))\r\n- The `evm run` command no longer overwrites the sender account in genesis.json. ([#30259](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30259))\r\n- `evm run` now allows configuring `baseFeePerGas` in genesis.json. ([#30281](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30281))\r\n\r\n### Go API\r\n\r\n- `core/types.Transaction.ChainID` had a bug where it modified the signature for very large ChainID (>= 2^64). ([#30157](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30157))\r\n- `ethclient.Client.NetworkID` now supports values returned in hex format by the server. ([#30263](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30263))\r\n- `ethclient/simulated.Backend.AdjustTime` was fixed to apply the correct time divison. ([#30138](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30138))\r\n- `accounts/abi/bind.TransactOpts` now supports setting an access list for created transactions. ([#30195](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30195))\r\n- The package `p2p/simulations` has been removed. ([#30250](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30250))\r\n\r\n### Core\r\n\r\n- A snap-sync database corruption related to sync restarts is fixed in this release. ([#30258](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30258))\r\n- `eth_call` storage overrides now work as originally intended: if a storage replacement object is specified in the call, previous storage values of the account are cleared. ([#30185](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30185))\r\n- The txpool did not use the transaction's inline sender cache in some cases. ([#30208](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30208))\r\n- The performance of EVM stack swaps was improved a bit. ([#30249](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30249))\r\n\r\n### Networking\r\n\r\n- The downloader now takes withdrawals into account when sizing its queue. ([#30276](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30276))\r\n- The new discovery node revalidation could hot-spin in certain rare scenarios. ([#30239](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30239))\r\n- Configuring an external IP using `--nat=extip:...` could lead to invalid discovery packets being generated. ([#30234](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30234))\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- github.com/btcsuite/btcd/btcec has been upgraded to resolve a build error caused by upstream API changes. ([#30181](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30181))\r\n- Previous releases will not build with Go 1.23, but this one will. ([#30253](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30253))\r\n- This release is built with Go 1.22.6. ([#30273](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/30273))\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth [1.14.8 release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/171?closed=1).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs with all our previous releases, you can find the:\r\n\r\n- Pre-built binaries for all platforms on our [downloads page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).\r\n- Docker images published under [`ethereum/client-go`](https://cloud.docker.com/u/ethereum/repository/docker/ethereum/client-go).\r\n- Ubuntu packages in our [Launchpad PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\r\n- OSX packages in our [Homebrew Tap repository](https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum).\r\n",

    "body": "Geth v1.14.0 (Asteria) is a major release with some juicy new features as well as some breaking changes. Please read through the release notes before updating to it. Whilst it should not adversely impact most users, there're always those rare occurrences.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n\r\n- Geth v1.14.0 switches over the default state trie representation from `hash` mode to `path` mode (i.e. `--state.scheme` flipped form `hash` to `path`) ([#29108](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29108)). This change does not affect Geth instances with pre-existing databases, in the case of which Geth continues to use whatever the existing database's format is. If no previous database exists however, for full nodes, Geth will now default to `pathdb`. The main advantage is built-in, online historical state pruning; no more runaway state growth.\r\n  - **If you want to force the old behaviour, you can run Geth with `--state.scheme=hash` for now.** That said, we will be dropping `hash` mode sooner rather than later, so we advise everyone running full nodes to gradually switch, if they haven't yet.\r\n  - **Archive mode support is not yet finalised for `path` mode, so archive nodes will still run in `hash` mode.** Naturally, hash mode will not be dropped until a full `path` archive lands and people have enough time to switch to it.\r\n\r\n- Geth v1.14.0 introduces a brand new *live-tracing* feature, where one or more transaction tracers might be injected into the block processing pipeline, ensuring that tracing and execution happen in lockstep ([#29189](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29189)). Since Go does not have a cross platform, OS native plugin infrastructure, adding live tracers needs to be done at the Geth source code level, and Geth itself subsequently rebuilt. That said, the advantage is that such tracers have full execution flexibility to do whatever they like and however they like. Please see the live-tracer [changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/tracing/CHANGELOG.md) and [docs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/evm-tracing/live-tracing) for details.\r\n  - **Live tracing runs in lockstep with block execution, one waiting for the other.** You should never run a live tracer on a validating node, or any other where latency is important. The recommended practice is to have tracers collect and export the bare minimum data needed and do any post-processing in external systems where latency is not relevant.\r\n  - **The live tracer work required a number of breaking internal API changes.** If you had your own native tracers implemented before this change, the [changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/tracing/CHANGELOG.md) contains the necessary steps needed to update your old code for the new APIs.\r\n\r\n- Geth v1.14.0 replaces the completely random transaction propagation paths (in the Ethereum P2P network) with pseudo-random ones, that ensure transactions from the same account follow the same path in the network (as long as no peer churn happens). The purpose is to allow a burst of transactions from the same account to ripple through the network on the same connections, minimising reordering. Whilst this doesn't provide any guarantees, nor does it replace the potential need for more complex routing logic, it should make nonce gaps significantly less likely, reducing the probability of dropped transactions during bursts ([#29034](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29034)).\r\n  - **This change only applies to networking, so other clients are not required to follow suit.** That said, the network would behave more consistently overall if all clients implemented some similar logic (the exact routing algorithm is irrelevant, as long as it's stable in the accounts).\r\n\r\n- Geth v1.14.0 drops support for running pre-merge networks ([#29169](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29169)). This does not mean that Geth will not be able to process or validate pre-merge blocks, rather that starting v1.14.0, Geth *must* have a consensus client drive it's chain selection. Geth drops the *forward-sync* mode of operation, where it imports blocks based on PoW (ethash) or PoA (clique) difficulties.\r\n  - **Non-merged networks will need to stick to Geth v1.13.x until they transition to post-merge.** As Ethereum has transitioned towards a post-merge world, we cannot maintain a significant chunk of code that's been dead for 2 years now on mainnet.\r\n  - **Post-merge networks must be marked so with the `terminalTotalDifficultyPassed: true` field in their `genesis.json`.** This requirement will be dropped (along with even caring at all about this field) in a few releases, but for now this field produces a clear error message for the user of what's wrong with their pre-merge network.\r\n\r\n- Geth v1.14.0 stops automatically constructing the pending block ([#28623](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28623)). Performance wise there is a significant cost to creating a potential pending block, yet most node operators do not care about it. Not even validators need the pending block. This work also drops support for mining/signing a block \"off-demand\" (i.e. not via the engine API, rather by Geth itself), meaning Clique signing is also removed going forward.\r\n  - **With Clique mining removed, Geth v1.14.0 cannot be a Clique signer any more.** This however goes hand-in-hand with the removal or pre-merge chain selection and synchronisation support described earlier.\r\n  - **The pending block can still be constructed on demand for now.** Whenever an RPC method is called that is based on the pending block, Geth will generate it on the fly and cache it for 1 second for subsequent calls. The first such call will have a few hundred ms execution delay.\r\n\r\n- **Geth v1.14.0 removes support for filtering pending logs.** This is following the previous change of creating the pending block only on demand. We see next to no value in monitoring the logs of a random subset of transactions that might (but probably mostly will not) end up in the next block. Power users who wish to monitor the transaction pool for MEV (or similar) purposes, should hook into Geth directly and extract the exact data they need, rather than rely on insufficient API endpoints.\r\n\r\n- Geth v1.14.0 ships a *beacon chain* light client ([#28822](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28822), [#29308](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29308), [#29335](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29335), [#29532](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29532), [#29567](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29567)). It uses the REST API of beacon nodes and requires the `beacon / light_client namespace`, currently supported by Lodestar and Nimbus ([specs](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/#/Beacon)).\r\n  - **The beacon light client provides access to consensus layer data, not execution layer data.** This currently means that it can follow the beacon chain as a light client and extract the latest head and finalised execution layer block. That can be used to drive a full execution node without running an own beacon node. There is no support yet for a full execution light client.\r\n  -  **Validation and staking is not possible with a beacon light client.** Since the sync committee signatures on each beacon head are canonised in the next block, the beacon light client can only follow the chain with one slot delay.\r\n  - **The beacon light client exists both as a standalone executable and integrated into Geth.** The `blsync` executable can drive any execution layer node through the standard engine API or can just do a \"test run\" printing block numbers and hashes to the console. The integrated mode can do the same inside Geth. If you specify at least one suitable consensus layer REST API endpoint with the `--beacon.api` flag, then Geth will run without a beacon node connected through the engine API.\r\n\r\n- Geth v1.14.0 switched to using Go v1.22 by default ([#28946](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28946)), which means we've dropped support for Go v1.20. Geth also started using of new features from Go v1.21 in our codebase, so building with Go v1.20 will probably error from now on. Just a heads up.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- Add the `geth db inspect-history` command to inspect pathdb state history ([#29267](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29267)).\r\n- Enable the Cancun hard-fork when running Geth in dev mode ([#28829](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28829)).\r\n- Use beacon chain finality as the marker to move old blocks into ancients ([#28683](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28683)).\r\n- Drop large-contract (500MB+) deletion DoS protection from pathdb post Cancun ([#28940](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28940)).\r\n- Switch Geth's USB library from `libusb` to `hid` for simpler hardware wallet support ([#28945](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/28945), [#29175](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29175), [#29176](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29176)).\r\n- Update the `prestateTrancer` to take into account 4844 blobs and their fees ([#29168](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29168)).\r\n- Extend the `ethclient` and `gethclient` packages with support for 4844 blob fields ([#29198](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29198)).\r\n- Detailed block execution metrics are now always reported, deprecating `--metrics.expensive` ([#29191](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29191)).\r\n- Avoid a lot of memory allocations while shuffling 4844 blobs within Geth ([#29050](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29050)).\r\n- Switch to using Go's native `log/slog` package instead of `golang/exp` ([#29302](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29302)).\r\n- When computing state roots, apply state updates before deletes to avoid some trie lookups.

([#29020](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29020))\r\n- The blobpool database will now recover from disk corruption faults instead of crashing geth on startup. ([#29001](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/29001))\r\n- Geth now implements `getClientVersionV1` on the Engine API endpoint.
