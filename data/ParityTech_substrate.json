    "body": "# Changelog for Substrate 3.0.0/0.9.0 - Apollo 14\r\n\r\nMost notably, this is the first release of the new FRAME (2.0) with its new macro-syntax and some changes in types, and pallet versioning. This release also incorporates the faster and improved version 2.0 of the parity-scale-codec and upgraded dependencies all-around. While the `FinalityTracker` pallet has been dropped, this release marks the first public appearance of a few new pallets, too: Bounties, Lottery, Tips (extracted from the `Treasury`-pallet, see #7536) and Merkle-Mountain-Ranges (MMR).\r\n\r\nOn the client side, the most notable changes are around the keystore, making it async and switching to a different signing model allowing for remote-signing to be implemented. Various changes to improve networking and light-client support, like adding the Grandpa warp sync request-response protocol (#7711) are also included.\r\n\r\n_Contracts_: Please note that the contracts pallet _is not part_ of this release. The pallet is not yet ready and will be released separately in the coming weeks. The currently released contracts pallet _is not compatible_ with the new FRAME, thus if you need the contracts pallet, we recommend you wait with the upgrade until it has been released, too.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade instructions\r\n\r\nNot too much has changed on the top and API level for developing Substrate betweeen 2.0 and 3.0. The easiest and quickest path for upgrading is to just take the latest node-template and try applying your changes to it:\r\n1. take a diff between 2.0 and your changes\r\n2. store that diff\r\n3. remove everything, copy over the 3.0 node-template\r\n4. try re-applying your diff, manually, a hunk at a time.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work for you, we are working on an in-depth-guide for all major changes that took place and how you need to adapt your code for it. [You can find the upgrade guide under `docs/` in the repo](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/docs/Upgrading-2.0-to-3.0.md), if you have further questions or problems, please [feel free to ask in the github discussion board](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/discussions).\r\n\r\n\r\nRuntime\r\n-------\r\n\r\n* Fix elections-phragmen and proxy issue (#7040)\r\n* Allow validators to block and kick their nominator set.
