You can now handle sessions on your server app. \r\n  - [Learn more in docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/server-side-rendering)\r\n- 2FA support is now added for Appwrite Auth and for Console users. \r\n  - [Learn about adding 2FA to your app](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/2fa) \r\n  - [Learn about 2FA on Console](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/security/2fa)\r\n- Appwrite Messaging added. You can now send emails, SMS messages, and push notifications. \r\n  - [Learn more in docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/messaging)\r\n- Appwrite now has enums for all config strings for OAuth, messaging adaptors, and more. \r\n  - [Learn more in the docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/sdks)\r\n- New runtime versions for Dart, Bun, Ruby, Node, Deno, Python, PHP, Kotlin, Java, and Swift. \r\n  - [Learn more in docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/runtimes)\r\n- Create custom login flows with custom sessions and tokens. \r\n  - [Learn more in docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/custom-token)\r\n\r\n### Upgrading\r\n- Appwrite Cloud is not yet updated to 1.5.x, expect an announcement in the upcoming weeks. If you lock your Appwrite SDK version, this update is not breaking.\r\n- Follow the [self-hosted docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting/update) to update your self-hosted Appwrite.\r\n- Update your SDKs to the latest versions. The API is backwards compatible, using old SDKs will not break existing apps, but you will not have access to new features.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @fanksin made their first contribution in https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/7276\r\n* @iMacHumphries made their first contribution in https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/7350\r\n* @UtkarshAhuja2003 made their first contribution in https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/7365\r\n* @Souptik2001 made their first contribution in https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/7559\r\n* @GuptaPratik02 made their first contribution in https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/6826\r\n* @navjotNSK made their first contribution in https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/7651\r\n* @DylanG-64 made their first contribution in https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/7728\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/compare/1.4.13...1.5.0",
