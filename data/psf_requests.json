It should\r\n  also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python\r\n  version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)\r\n- Requests now supports optional use of character detection\r\n  (`chardet` or `charset_normalizer`) when repackaged or vendored.\r\n  This enables `pip` and other projects to minimize their vendoring\r\n  surface area. The `Response.text()` and `apparent_encoding` APIs\r\n  will default to `utf-8` if neither library is present. (#6702)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\n- Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly\r\n  calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)\r\n- Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)\r\n- Fixed bug where an extra leading `/` (path separator) could lead\r\n  urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)\r\n\r\n**Deprecations**\r\n\r\n- Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)\r\n- Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)\r\n- Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)\r\n- Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n- Various typo fixes and doc improvements.\r\n\r\n**Packaging**\r\n- Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.\r\n  The source files for the projects (formerly `requests`) is now located\r\n  in `src/requests` in the Requests sdist. (#6506)\r\n- Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system\r\n  using `hatchling`. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old\r\n  versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @matthewarmand made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6258\r\n* @cpzt made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6456\r\n* @ittner made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6214\r\n* @ZetaTwo made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6465\r\n* @joren485 made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6475\r\n* @elprimato made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6266\r\n* @dependabot made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6499\r\n* @Ocupe made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6507\r\n* @13steinj made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6508\r\n* @jnhyperion made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6517\r\n* @swims-hjkl made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6552\r\n* @msea1 made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6574\r\n* @EFord36 made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6581\r\n* @MestreLion made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6600\r\n* @atatuzuner61 made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6592\r\n* @jaikishpai made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6605\r\n* @miketheman made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6613\r\n* @Tarty made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6629\r\n* @bruceadams made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6589\r\n* @amkarn258 made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6562\r\n* @flysee made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6302\r\n* @mbeijen made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6680\r\n* @franekmagiera made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6700\r\n* @agubelu made their first contribution in https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/6667\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/HISTORY.md#2320-2024-05-20",

    "body": "2.31.0 (2023-05-22)\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n**Security**\r\n- Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential\r\n  forwarding of `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers when\r\n  following HTTPS redirects.\r\n\r\n  When proxies are defined with user info (https://user:pass@proxy:8080), Requests\r\n  will construct a `Proxy-Authorization` header that is attached to the request to\r\n  authenticate with the proxy.\r\n\r\n  In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached\r\n  the `Proxy-Authorization` header incorrectly, resulting in the value being\r\n  sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on\r\n  defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade\r\n  to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy\r\n  credentials once the change has been fully deployed.\r\n\r\n  Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through\r\n  the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this\r\n  vulnerability.\r\n\r\n  Full details can be read in our [Github Security Advisory](https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q)\r\n  and [CVE-2023-32681](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681).",

    "body": "2.28.0 (2022-06-09)\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n**Deprecations**\r\n\r\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Requests has officially dropped support for Python 2.7. \u26a0\ufe0f (#6091)\r\n- Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.6 (including pypy3). (#6091)\r\n\r\n**Improvements**\r\n\r\n- Wrap JSON parsing issues in Request's JSONDecodeError for payloads without\r\n  an encoding to make `json()` API consistent. (#6097)\r\n- Parse header components consistently, raising an InvalidHeader error in\r\n  all invalid cases. (#6154)\r\n- Added provisional 3.11 support with current beta build. (#6155)\r\n- Requests got a makeover and we decided to paint it black. (#6095)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug where setting `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` to an empty string would disable\r\n  cert verification. All Requests 2.x versions before 2.28.0 are affected. (#6074)\r\n- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.SSLError` with\r\n  `requests.exceptions.SSLError` for `content` and `iter_content`. (#6057)\r\n- Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entires caused proxy resolution\r\n  to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry. (#6149)\r\n- Fixed issue where entire payload could be included in the error message for\r\n  JSONDecodeError.

    "body": "2.27.0 (2022-01-03)\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n**Improvements**\r\n\r\n- Officially added support for Python 3.10. (#5928)\r\n\r\n- Added a `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` to unify JSON exceptions between\r\n  Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the `response.json()` method, and is\r\n  backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.\r\n  Can be caught from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` as well. (#5856)\r\n\r\n- Improved error text for misnamed `InvalidSchema` and `MissingSchema`\r\n  exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed\r\n  (Schema->Scheme). (#6017)\r\n\r\n- Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address\r\n  recent changes to `urlparse` in Python 3.9+. (#5917)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\n\r\n- Fixed defect in `extract_zipped_paths` which could result in an infinite loop\r\n  for some paths. (#5851)\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling for `AttributeError` when calculating length of files obtained\r\n  by `Tarfile.extractfile()`. (#5239)\r\n\r\n- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader` with\r\n  `requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader`. (#5914)\r\n\r\n- Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (#5391)\r\n\r\n- Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where `Proxy-Authorization` was\r\n  incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with `Session.send`. (#5924)\r\n\r\n- Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of\r\n  proxies available in the environment. (#5924)\r\n\r\n- Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping `UnicodeError` with\r\n  `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the\r\n  domain. (#5414)\r\n\r\n**Deprecations**\r\n\r\n- Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022.
