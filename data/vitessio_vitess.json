For example:\n\n```bash\n$ vtctldclient --server :15999 MoveTables --target-keyspace customer --workflow commerce2customer MirrorTraffic --percent 5.0\n```\n\nMirror rules can be inspected with `GetMirrorRules`.\n\n### <a id=\"atomic-transaction\"/>Atomic Distributed Transaction Support</a>\n\nWe have introduced atomic distributed transactions as an experimental feature.\nUsers can now run multi-shard transactions with stronger guarantees. \nVitess now provides two modes of transactional guarantees for multi-shard transactions: Best Effort and Atomic. \nThese can be selected based on the user\u2019s requirements and the trade-offs they are willing to make.\n\nFollow the documentation to enable [Atomic Distributed Transaction](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/features/distributed-transaction/)\n\nFor more details on the implementation and trade-offs, please refer to the [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/16245)\n\n### <a id=\"new-vtgate-shutdown-behavior\"/>New VTGate Shutdown Behavior</a>\n\nWe added a new option to VTGate to disallow new connections while VTGate is shutting down,\nwhile allowing existing connections to finish their work until they manually disconnect or until\nthe `--onterm_timeout` is reached, without getting a `Server shutdown in progress` error.\n\nThis new behavior can be enabled by specifying the new `--mysql-server-drain-onterm` flag to VTGate.\n\nYou can find more information about this option in the [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15971).\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-throttler\"/>Tablet Throttler: Multi-Metric support</a>\n\nUp until `v20`, the tablet throttler would only monitor and use a single metric. That would be replication lag, by\ndefault, or could be the result of a custom query. In this release, we introduce a major redesign so that the throttler \nmonitors and uses multiple metrics at the same time, including the above two.\n\nThe default behavior now is to monitor all metrics, but only use `lag` (if the custom query is undefined) or the `custom` \nmetric (if the custom query is defined). This is backwards-compatible with `v20`. A `v20` `PRIMARY` is compatible with\na `v21` `REPLICA`, and a `v21` `PRIMARY` is compatible with a `v20` `REPLICA`.\n\nHowever, it is now possible to assign any combination of one or more metrics for a given app. The throttler\nwould then accept or reject the app's requests based on the health of _all_ assigned metrics. We have provided a pre-defined\nlist of metrics:\n\n- `lag`: replication lag based on heartbeat injection.\n- `threads_running`: concurrent active threads on the MySQL server.\n- `loadavg`: per core load average measured on the tablet instance/pod.\n- `custom`: the result of a custom query executed on the MySQL server.\n\nEach metric has a default threshold which can be overridden by the `UpdateThrottlerConfig` command.\n\nThe throttler also supports the catch-all `\"all\"` app name, and it is thus possible to assign metrics to **all** apps.\nExplicit app to metric assignments will override the catch-all configuration.\n\nMetrics are assigned a default _scope_, which could be `self` (isolated to the tablet) or `shard` (max, aka **worst**\nvalue among shard tablets). It is further possible to require a different scope for each metric.\n\n### <a id=\"allow-cross-cell\"/>Allow Cross Cell Promotion in PRS</a>\n\nUp until now if the users wanted to promote a replica in a different cell from the current primary\nusing `PlannedReparentShard`, they had to specify the new primary with the `--new-primary` flag.\n\nWe have now added a new flag `--allow-cross-cell-promotion` that lets `PlannedReparentShard` choose a primary in a\ndifferent cell even if no new primary is provided explicitly.\n\n### <a id=\"recursive-cte\"/>Experimental support for recursive CTEs</a>\n\nWe have added experimental support for recursive CTEs in Vitess. We are marking it as experimental because it is not yet\nfully tested and may have some limitations. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-balancer\"/>VTGate Tablet Balancer</a>\n\nWhen a VTGate routes a query and has multiple available tablets for a given shard / tablet type (e.g. REPLICA), the\ncurrent default behavior routes the query with local cell affinity and round robin policy. The VTGate Tablet Balancer\nprovides an alternate mechanism that routes queries to maintain an even distribution of query load to each tablet, while\npreferentially routing to tablets in the same cell as the VTGate.\n\nThe tablet balancer is enabled by a new flag `--enable-balancer` and configured by `--balancer-vtgate-cells`\nand `--balancer-keyspaces`.\n\nSee the [RFC ](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12241) for more details on the design and configuration of this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout Override</a>\n\nVTGate sends an authoritative query timeout to VTTablet when the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive,\n`query_timeout` session system variable, or `query-timeout` flag is set.\nThe order of precedence is: comment directive > session variable > VTGate flag.\nVTTablet overrides its default query timeout with the value received from VTGate.\nAll timeouts are specified in milliseconds.\n\nWhen a query is executed inside a transaction, there is an additional nuance. The actual timeout used will be the smaller \nof the transaction timeout and the query timeout.\n\nA query can also be set to have no timeout by using the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive with a value of `0`.\n\nExample usage:\n`select /*vt+ QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=30 */ col from tbl`\n\n### <a id=\"new-backup-engine\"/>New Backup Engine (EXPERIMENTAL)</a>\n\nWe are introducing a new backup engine for logical backups in order to support use cases that require something other \nthan physical backups. This feature is experimental and is based on [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/).\n\nThe new engine is enabled by using `--backup_engine_implementation=mysqlshell`. There are other options that are required, \nso please read the [documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/creating-a-backup/) to learn which options are required and how to configure them.\n\n### <a id=\"dynamic-vreplication-configuration\"/>Dynamic VReplication Configuration</a>\n\nPreviously, many of the configuration options for VReplication Workflows had to be provided using VTTablet flags. This \nmeant that any change to VReplication configuration required restarting VTTablets. We now allow these to be overridden \nwhile creating a workflow or dynamically after the workflow is already in progress.\n\n### <a id=\"reference-table-materialization\"/>Reference Table Materialization</a>\n\nThere is a new option in [`Materialize` workflows](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/materialize/) to keep a synced copy of [reference or lookup tables](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/reference_tables/) \n(countries, states, zip codes, etc) from an unsharded keyspace, which holds the source of truth for the reference \ntable, to all shards in a sharded keyspace.\n\n### <a id=\"new-vexplain-modes\"/>New VEXPLAIN Modes: TRACE and KEYS</a>\n\n#### VEXPLAIN TRACE\n\nThe new `TRACE` mode for `VEXPLAIN` provides a detailed execution trace of queries, showing how they're processed through various \noperators and interactions with tablets. This mode is particularly useful for:\n\n- Identifying performance bottlenecks\n- Understanding query execution patterns\n- Optimizing complex queries\n- Debugging unexpected query behavior\n\n`TRACE` mode runs the query and logs all interactions, returning a JSON representation of the query execution plan with additional \nstatistics like number of calls, average rows processed, and number of shards queried.\n\n#### VEXPLAIN KEYS\n\nThe `KEYS` mode for `VEXPLAIN` offers a concise summary of query structure, highlighting columns used in joins, filters, and \ngrouping operations. This information is crucial for:\n\n- Identifying potential sharding key candidates\n- Optimizing query performance\n- Analyzing query patterns to inform database design decisions\n\n`KEYS` mode analyzes the query structure without executing it, providing JSON output that includes grouping columns, join columns, \nfilter columns (potential candidates for indexes, primary keys, or sharding keys), and the statement type.\n\nThese new `VEXPLAIN` modes enhance Vitess's query analysis capabilities, allowing for more informed decisions about sharding \nstrategies and query optimization.\n\n### <a id=\"auto-replace-mysql-autoinc-with-seq\"/>Automatically Replace MySQL auto_increment Clauses with Vitess Sequences</a>\n\nIn https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/16860 we added support for replacing MySQL `auto_increment` clauses with [Vitess Sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/), performing all of the setup and initialization\nwork automatically during the [`MoveTables`](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/movetables/) workflow. As part of that work we have deprecated the\n[`--remove-sharded-auto-increment` boolean flag](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and you should begin using the new\n[`--sharded-auto-increment-handling` flag](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) instead. Please see the new\n[`MoveTables` Auto Increment Handling](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/vreplication/movetables/#auto-increment-handling) documentation for additional details.\n\n### <a id=\"experimental-mysql-84\"/>Experimental MySQL 8.4 support\n\nWe have added experimental support for MySQL 8.4. It passes the Vitess test suite, but it is otherwise not yet tested. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this to move support out of the experimental phase in a future release.\n\n### <a id=\"errant-gtid-metric\"/>Current Errant GTIDs Count Metric\nA new metric called `CurrentErrantGTIDCount` has been added to the `VTOrc` component. \nThis metric shows the current count of the errant GTIDs in the tablets.\n\n### <a id=\"vtctldclient-changetablettags\"/>`vtctldclient ChangeTabletTags` command\n\nThe `vtctldclient` command `ChangeTabletTags` was added to allow the tags of a tablet to be changed dynamically.\n\n### <a id=\"reparents-expectedprimary\"/>Support specifying expected primary in reparents\n\nThe `EmergencyReparentShard` and `PlannedReparentShard` commands and RPCs now support specifying a primary we expect to still be the current primary in order for a reparent operation to be processed. This allows reparents to be conditional on a specific state being true.\n\n------------\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/21.0/21.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 364 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @GrahamCampbell, @GuptaManan100, @Utkar5hM, @anshikavashistha, @app/dependabot, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @cameronmccord2, @chrism1001, @cuishuang, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @harshitasao, @icyflame, @kirtanchandak, @mattlord, @mattrobenolt, @maxenglander, @mcrauwel, @notfelineit, @perminov, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @runewake2, @rvrangel, @shanth96, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @vitess-bot\n\n",

When\ntraffic mirroring is enabled, VTGate will mirror a percentage of traffic from one keyspace to another.\n\nMirror rules may be enabled through `vtctldclient` with `MoveTables MirrorTraffic`. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ vtctldclient --server :15999 MoveTables --target-keyspace customer --workflow commerce2customer MirrorTraffic --percent 5.0\n```\n\nMirror rules can be inspected with `GetMirrorRules`.\n\n### <a id=\"new-vtgate-shutdown-behavior\"/>New VTGate Shutdown Behavior</a>\n\nWe added a new option to VTGate to disallow new connections while VTGate is shutting down,\nwhile allowing existing connections to finish their work until they manually disconnect or until\nthe `--onterm_timeout` is reached, without getting a `Server shutdown in progress` error.\n\nThis new behavior can be enabled by specifying the new `--mysql-server-drain-onterm` flag to VTGate.\n\nYou can find more information about this option in the [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15971).\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-throttler\"/>Tablet Throttler: Multi-Metric support</a>\n\nUp until `v20`, the tablet throttler would only monitor and use a single metric. That would be replication lag, by\ndefault, or could be the result of a custom query. In this release, we introduce a major redesign so that the throttler \nmonitors and uses multiple metrics at the same time, including the above two.\n\nThe default behavior now is to monitor all metrics, but only use `lag` (if the custom query is undefined) or the `custom` \nmetric (if the custom query is defined). This is backwards-compatible with `v20`. A `v20` `PRIMARY` is compatible with\na `v21` `REPLICA`, and a `v21` `PRIMARY` is compatible with a `v20` `REPLICA`.\n\nHowever, it is now possible to assign any combination of one or more metrics for a given app. The throttler\nwould then accept or reject the app's requests based on the health of _all_ assigned metrics. We have provided a pre-defined\nlist of metrics:\n\n- `lag`: replication lag based on heartbeat injection.\n- `threads_running`: concurrent active threads on the MySQL server.\n- `loadavg`: per core load average measured on the tablet instance/pod.\n- `custom`: the result of a custom query executed on the MySQL server.\n\nEach metric has a default threshold which can be overridden by the `UpdateThrottlerConfig` command.\n\nThe throttler also supports the catch-all `\"all\"` app name, and it is thus possible to assign metrics to **all** apps.\nExplicit app to metric assignments will override the catch-all configuration.\n\nMetrics are assigned a default _scope_, which could be `self` (isolated to the tablet) or `shard` (max, aka **worst**\nvalue among shard tablets). It is further possible to require a different scope for each metric.\n\n### <a id=\"allow-cross-cell\"/>Allow Cross Cell Promotion in PRS</a>\n\nUp until now if the users wanted to promote a replica in a different cell from the current primary\nusing `PlannedReparentShard`, they had to specify the new primary with the `--new-primary` flag.\n\nWe have now added a new flag `--allow-cross-cell-promotion` that lets `PlannedReparentShard` choose a primary in a\ndifferent cell even if no new primary is provided explicitly.\n\n### <a id=\"recursive-cte\"/>Experimental support for recursive CTEs</a>\n\nWe have added experimental support for recursive CTEs in Vitess. We are marking it as experimental because it is not yet\nfully tested and may have some limitations. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-balancer\"/>VTGate Tablet Balancer</a>\n\nWhen a VTGate routes a query and has multiple available tablets for a given shard / tablet type (e.g. REPLICA), the\ncurrent default behavior routes the query with local cell affinity and round robin policy. The VTGate Tablet Balancer\nprovides an alternate mechanism that routes queries to maintain an even distribution of query load to each tablet, while\npreferentially routing to tablets in the same cell as the VTGate.\n\nThe tablet balancer is enabled by a new flag `--enable-balancer` and configured by `--balancer-vtgate-cells`\nand `--balancer-keyspaces`.\n\nSee the [RFC ](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12241) for more details on the design and configuration of this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout Override</a>\n\nVTGate sends an authoritative query timeout to VTTablet when the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive,\n`query_timeout` session system variable, or `query-timeout` flag is set.\nThe order of precedence is: comment directive > session variable > VTGate flag.\nVTTablet overrides its default query timeout with the value received from VTGate.\nAll timeouts are specified in milliseconds.\n\nWhen a query is executed inside a transaction, there is an additional nuance. The actual timeout used will be the smaller \nof the transaction timeout and the query timeout.\n\nA query can also be set to have no timeout by using the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive with a value of `0`.\n\nExample usage:\n`select /*vt+ QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=30 */ col from tbl`\n\n### <a id=\"new-backup-engine\"/>New Backup Engine (EXPERIMENTAL)</a>\n\nWe are introducing a new backup engine for logical backups in order to support use cases that require something other \nthan physical backups. This feature is experimental and is based on [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/).\n\nThe new engine is enabled by using `--backup_engine_implementation=mysqlshell`. There are other options that are required, \nso please read the [documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/creating-a-backup/) to learn which options are required and how to configure them.\n\n### <a id=\"dynamic-vreplication-configuration\"/>Dynamic VReplication Configuration</a>\n\nPreviously, many of the configuration options for VReplication Workflows had to be provided using VTTablet flags. This \nmeant that any change to VReplication configuration required restarting VTTablets. We now allow these to be overridden \nwhile creating a workflow or dynamically after the workflow is already in progress.\n\n### <a id=\"reference-table-materialization\"/>Reference Table Materialization</a>\n\nThere is a new option in [`Materialize` workflows](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/materialize/) to keep a synced copy of [reference or lookup tables](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/reference_tables/) \n(countries, states, zip codes, etc) from an unsharded keyspace, which holds the source of truth for the reference \ntable, to all shards in a sharded keyspace.\n\n### <a id=\"new-vexplain-modes\"/>New VEXPLAIN Modes: TRACE and KEYS</a>\n\n#### VEXPLAIN TRACE\n\nThe new `TRACE` mode for `VEXPLAIN` provides a detailed execution trace of queries, showing how they're processed through various \noperators and interactions with tablets. This mode is particularly useful for:\n\n- Identifying performance bottlenecks\n- Understanding query execution patterns\n- Optimizing complex queries\n- Debugging unexpected query behavior\n\n`TRACE` mode runs the query and logs all interactions, returning a JSON representation of the query execution plan with additional \nstatistics like number of calls, average rows processed, and number of shards queried.\n\n#### VEXPLAIN KEYS\n\nThe `KEYS` mode for `VEXPLAIN` offers a concise summary of query structure, highlighting columns used in joins, filters, and \ngrouping operations. This information is crucial for:\n\n- Identifying potential sharding key candidates\n- Optimizing query performance\n- Analyzing query patterns to inform database design decisions\n\n`KEYS` mode analyzes the query structure without executing it, providing JSON output that includes grouping columns, join columns, \nfilter columns (potential candidates for indexes, primary keys, or sharding keys), and the statement type.\n\nThese new `VEXPLAIN` modes enhance Vitess's query analysis capabilities, allowing for more informed decisions about sharding \nstrategies and query optimization.\n\n### <a id=\"errant-gtid-vttablet\"/>Errant GTID Detection on VTTablets</a>\n\nVTTablets now run an errant GTID detection logic before they join the replication stream. So, if a replica has an errant GTID, it will\nnot start replicating from the primary. This protects us from running into situations which are very difficult to recover from.\n\nFor users running with the vitess-operator on Kubernetes, this change means that replica tablets with errant GTIDs will have broken \nreplication and will report as unready. Users will need to manually replace and clean up these errant replica tablets.\n\n### <a id=\"auto-replace-mysql-autoinc-with-seq\"/>Automatically Replace MySQL auto_increment Clauses with Vitess Sequences</a>\n\nIn https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/16860 we added support for replacing MySQL `auto_increment` clauses with [Vitess Sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/), performing all of the setup and initialization\nwork automatically during the [`MoveTables`](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/movetables/) workflow. As part of that work we have deprecated the\n[`--remove-sharded-auto-increment` boolean flag](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and you should begin using the new\n[`--sharded-auto-increment-handling` flag](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) instead. Please see the new\n[`MoveTables` Auto Increment Handling](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/vreplication/movetables/#auto-increment-handling) documentation for additional details.\n\n### <a id=\"experimental-mysql-84\"/>Experimental MySQL 8.4 support\n\nWe have added experimental support for MySQL 8.4. It passes the Vitess test suite, but it is otherwise not yet tested. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this to move support out of the experimental phase in a future release.\n\n### <a id=\"errant-gtid-metric\"/>Current Errant GTIDs Count Metric\nA new metric called `CurrentErrantGTIDCount` has been added to the `VTOrc` component. \nThis metric shows the current count of the errant GTIDs in the tablets.\n\n### <a id=\"vtctldclient-changetablettags\"/>`vtctldclient ChangeTabletTags` command\n\nThe `vtctldclient` command `ChangeTabletTags` was added to allow the tags of a tablet to be changed dynamically.\n\n### <a id=\"reparents-expectedprimary\"/>Support specifying expected primary in reparents\n\nThe `EmergencyReparentShard` and `PlannedReparentShard` commands and RPCs now support specifying a primary we expect to still be the current primary in order for a reparent operation to be processed. This allows reparents to be conditional on a specific state being true.\n\n------------\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/21.0/21.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 354 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @GrahamCampbell, @GuptaManan100, @Utkar5hM, @anshikavashistha, @app/dependabot, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @cameronmccord2, @chrism1001, @cuishuang, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @harshitasao, @icyflame, @kirtanchandak, @mattlord, @mattrobenolt, @maxenglander, @mcrauwel, @notfelineit, @perminov, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @runewake2, @rvrangel, @shanth96, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @vitess-bot\n\n",

When\ntraffic mirroring is enabled, VTGate will mirror a percentage of traffic from one keyspace to another.\n\nMirror rules may be enabled through `vtctldclient` with `MoveTables MirrorTraffic`. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ vtctldclient --server :15999 MoveTables --target-keyspace customer --workflow commerce2customer MirrorTraffic --percent 5.0\n```\n\nMirror rules can be inspected with `GetMirrorRules`.\n\n### <a id=\"new-vtgate-shutdown-behavior\"/>New VTGate Shutdown Behavior</a>\n\nWe added a new option to VTGate to disallow new connections while VTGate is shutting down,\nwhile allowing existing connections to finish their work until they manually disconnect or until\nthe `--onterm_timeout` is reached, without getting a `Server shutdown in progress` error.\n\nThis new behavior can be enabled by specifying the new `--mysql-server-drain-onterm` flag to VTGate.\n\nYou can find more information about this option in the [RFC](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15971).\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-throttler\"/>Tablet Throttler: Multi-Metric support</a>\n\nUp until `v20`, the tablet throttler would only monitor and use a single metric. That would be replication lag, by\ndefault, or could be the result of a custom query. In this release, we introduce a major redesign so that the throttler \nmonitors and uses multiple metrics at the same time, including the above two.\n\nThe default behavior now is to monitor all metrics, but only use `lag` (if the custom query is undefined) or the `custom` \nmetric (if the custom query is defined). This is backwards-compatible with `v20`. A `v20` `PRIMARY` is compatible with\na `v21` `REPLICA`, and a `v21` `PRIMARY` is compatible with a `v20` `REPLICA`.\n\nHowever, it is now possible to assign any combination of one or more metrics for a given app. The throttler\nwould then accept or reject the app's requests based on the health of _all_ assigned metrics. We have provided a pre-defined\nlist of metrics:\n\n- `lag`: replication lag based on heartbeat injection.\n- `threads_running`: concurrent active threads on the MySQL server.\n- `loadavg`: per core load average measured on the tablet instance/pod.\n- `custom`: the result of a custom query executed on the MySQL server.\n\nEach metric has a default threshold which can be overridden by the `UpdateThrottlerConfig` command.\n\nThe throttler also supports the catch-all `\"all\"` app name, and it is thus possible to assign metrics to **all** apps.\nExplicit app to metric assignments will override the catch-all configuration.\n\nMetrics are assigned a default _scope_, which could be `self` (isolated to the tablet) or `shard` (max, aka **worst**\nvalue among shard tablets). It is further possible to require a different scope for each metric.\n\n### <a id=\"allow-cross-cell\"/>Allow Cross Cell Promotion in PRS</a>\n\nUp until now if the users wanted to promote a replica in a different cell from the current primary\nusing `PlannedReparentShard`, they had to specify the new primary with the `--new-primary` flag.\n\nWe have now added a new flag `--allow-cross-cell-promotion` that lets `PlannedReparentShard` choose a primary in a\ndifferent cell even if no new primary is provided explicitly.\n\n### <a id=\"recursive-cte\"/>Experimental support for recursive CTEs</a>\n\nWe have added experimental support for recursive CTEs in Vitess. We are marking it as experimental because it is not yet\nfully tested and may have some limitations. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"tablet-balancer\"/>VTGate Tablet Balancer</a>\n\nWhen a VTGate routes a query and has multiple available tablets for a given shard / tablet type (e.g. REPLICA), the\ncurrent default behavior routes the query with local cell affinity and round robin policy. The VTGate Tablet Balancer\nprovides an alternate mechanism that routes queries to maintain an even distribution of query load to each tablet, while\npreferentially routing to tablets in the same cell as the VTGate.\n\nThe tablet balancer is enabled by a new flag `--enable-balancer` and configured by `--balancer-vtgate-cells`\nand `--balancer-keyspaces`.\n\nSee the [RFC ](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12241) for more details on the design and configuration of this feature.\n\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout Override</a>\n\nVTGate sends an authoritative query timeout to VTTablet when the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive,\n`query_timeout` session system variable, or `query-timeout` flag is set.\nThe order of precedence is: comment directive > session variable > VTGate flag.\nVTTablet overrides its default query timeout with the value received from VTGate.\nAll timeouts are specified in milliseconds.\n\nWhen a query is executed inside a transaction, there is an additional nuance. The actual timeout used will be the smaller \nof the transaction timeout and the query timeout.\n\nA query can also be set to have no timeout by using the `QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS` comment directive with a value of `0`.\n\nExample usage:\n`select /*vt+ QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=30 */ col from tbl`\n\n### <a id=\"new-backup-engine\"/>New Backup Engine (EXPERIMENTAL)</a>\n\nWe are introducing a new backup engine for logical backups in order to support use cases that require something other \nthan physical backups. This feature is experimental and is based on [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/).\n\nThe new engine is enabled by using `--backup_engine_implementation=mysqlshell`. There are other options that are required, \nso please read the [documentation](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/user-guides/operating-vitess/backup-and-restore/creating-a-backup/) to learn which options are required and how to configure them.\n\n### <a id=\"dynamic-vreplication-configuration\"/>Dynamic VReplication Configuration</a>\n\nPreviously, many of the configuration options for VReplication Workflows had to be provided using VTTablet flags. This \nmeant that any change to VReplication configuration required restarting VTTablets. We now allow these to be overridden \nwhile creating a workflow or dynamically after the workflow is already in progress.\n\n### <a id=\"reference-table-materialization\"/>Reference Table Materialization</a>\n\nThere is a new option in [`Materialize` workflows](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/materialize/) to keep a synced copy of [reference or lookup tables](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/reference_tables/) \n(countries, states, zip codes, etc) from an unsharded keyspace, which holds the source of truth for the reference \ntable, to all shards in a sharded keyspace.\n\n### <a id=\"new-vexplain-modes\"/>New VEXPLAIN Modes: TRACE and KEYS</a>\n\n#### VEXPLAIN TRACE\n\nThe new `TRACE` mode for `VEXPLAIN` provides a detailed execution trace of queries, showing how they're processed through various \noperators and interactions with tablets. This mode is particularly useful for:\n\n- Identifying performance bottlenecks\n- Understanding query execution patterns\n- Optimizing complex queries\n- Debugging unexpected query behavior\n\n`TRACE` mode runs the query and logs all interactions, returning a JSON representation of the query execution plan with additional \nstatistics like number of calls, average rows processed, and number of shards queried.\n\n#### VEXPLAIN KEYS\n\nThe `KEYS` mode for `VEXPLAIN` offers a concise summary of query structure, highlighting columns used in joins, filters, and \ngrouping operations. This information is crucial for:\n\n- Identifying potential sharding key candidates\n- Optimizing query performance\n- Analyzing query patterns to inform database design decisions\n\n`KEYS` mode analyzes the query structure without executing it, providing JSON output that includes grouping columns, join columns, \nfilter columns (potential candidates for indexes, primary keys, or sharding keys), and the statement type.\n\nThese new `VEXPLAIN` modes enhance Vitess's query analysis capabilities, allowing for more informed decisions about sharding \nstrategies and query optimization.\n\n### <a id=\"errant-gtid-vttablet\"/>Errant GTID Detection on VTTablets</a>\n\nVTTablets now run an errant GTID detection logic before they join the replication stream. So, if a replica has an errant GTID, it will\nnot start replicating from the primary. This protects us from running into situations which are very difficult to recover from.\n\nFor users running with the vitess-operator on Kubernetes, this change means that replica tablets with errant GTIDs will have broken \nreplication and will report as unready. Users will need to manually replace and clean up these errant replica tablets.\n\n### <a id=\"auto-replace-mysql-autoinc-with-seq\"/>Automatically Replace MySQL auto_increment Clauses with Vitess Sequences</a>\n\nIn https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/16860 we added support for replacing MySQL `auto_increment` clauses with [Vitess Sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/), performing all of the setup and initialization\nwork automatically during the [`MoveTables`](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/movetables/) workflow. As part of that work we have deprecated the\n[`--remove-sharded-auto-increment` boolean flag](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and you should begin using the new\n[`--sharded-auto-increment-handling` flag](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) instead. Please see the new\n[`MoveTables` Auto Increment Handling](https://vitess.io/docs/21.0/reference/vreplication/movetables/#auto-increment-handling) documentation for additional details.\n\n### <a id=\"experimental-mysql-84\"/>Experimental MySQL 8.4 support\n\nWe have added experimental support for MySQL 8.4. It passes the Vitess test suite, but it is otherwise not yet tested. We are looking for feedback from the community to improve this to move support out of the experimental phase in a future release.\n\n### <a id=\"errant-gtid-metric\"/>Current Errant GTIDs Count Metric\nA new metric called `CurrentErrantGTIDCount` has been added to the `VTOrc` component. \nThis metric shows the current count of the errant GTIDs in the tablets.\n\n### <a id=\"vtctldclient-changetablettags\"/>`vtctldclient ChangeTabletTags` command\n\nThe `vtctldclient` command `ChangeTabletTags` was added to allow the tags of a tablet to be changed dynamically.\n\n------------\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/21.0/21.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 338 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @GrahamCampbell, @GuptaManan100, @Utkar5hM, @anshikavashistha, @app/dependabot, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @cameronmccord2, @chrism1001, @cuishuang, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @harshitasao, @icyflame, @kirtanchandak, @mattlord, @mattrobenolt, @maxenglander, @mcrauwel, @notfelineit, @perminov, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @runewake2, @rvrangel, @shanth96, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @vitess-bot\n\n",

Users of `gh-ost` DDL strategy will need to supply a `gh-ost` binary on the `vttablet` host or pod. Vitess will look for the `gh-ost` binary in the system `PATH`; otherwise the user should supply `vttablet --gh-ost-path`.\r\n\r\nVitess' endtoend tests no longer use nor test `gh-ost` migrations.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"legacy-emergencyshardreparent-stats\"/>Legacy `EmergencyReparentShard` stats\r\n\r\nThe following `EmergencyReparentShard` stats were deprecated in Vitess 18.0 and are removed in Vitess 20.0:\r\n- `ers_counter`\r\n- `ers_success_counter`\r\n- `ers_failure_counter`\r\n\r\nThese counters are replaced by the following stats _(introduced in Vitess 18.0)_:\r\n- `emergency_reparent_counts` - Number of times `EmergencyReparentShard` has been run. It is further subdivided by the keyspace, shard and the result of the operation.\r\n- `planned_reparent_counts` - Number of times `PlannedReparentShard` has been run. It is further subdivided by the keyspace, shard and the result of the operation.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `reparent_shard_operation_timings` stat was added to provide per-operation timings of reparent operations.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"breaking-changes\"/>Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"metric-change-vtorc\"/>Metric Name Changes in VTOrc\r\n\r\nThe following metric names have been changed in VTOrc. The old metrics are still available in `/debug/vars` for this release, but will be removed in later releases. The new metric names and the deprecated metric names resolve to the same metric name on prometheus, so there is no change there.\r\n\r\n|               Old Metric Name                |             New Metric Name              |                 Name in Prometheus                 |\r\n|:--------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|\r\n|           `analysis.change.write`            |          `AnalysisChangeWrite`           |           `vtorc_analysis_change_write`            |  \r\n|                `audit.write`                 |               `AuditWrite`               |                `vtorc_audit_write`                 |  \r\n|            `discoveries.attempt`             |           `DiscoveriesAttempt`           |            `vtorc_discoveries_attempt`             |  \r\n|              `discoveries.fail`              |            `DiscoveriesFail`             |              `vtorc_discoveries_fail`              |  \r\n| `discoveries.instance_poll_seconds_exceeded` | `DiscoveriesInstancePollSecondsExceeded` | `vtorc_discoveries_instance_poll_seconds_exceeded` |  \r\n|          `discoveries.queue_length`          |         `DiscoveriesQueueLength`         |          `vtorc_discoveries_queue_length`          |  \r\n|          `discoveries.recent_count`          |         `DiscoveriesRecentCount`         |          `vtorc_discoveries_recent_count`          |  \r\n|               `instance.read`                |              `InstanceRead`              |               `vtorc_instance_read`                |  \r\n|           `instance.read_topology`           |          `InstanceReadTopology`          |           `vtorc_instance_read_topology`           |\r\n|         `emergency_reparent_counts`          |        `EmergencyReparentCounts`         |         `vtorc_emergency_reparent_counts`          |\r\n|          `planned_reparent_counts`           |         `PlannedReparentCounts`          |          `vtorc_planned_reparent_counts`           |\r\n|      `reparent_shard_operation_timings`      |     `ReparentShardOperationTimings`      |  `vtorc_reparent_shard_operation_timings_bucket`   |\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"enum-set-vstream\"/>ENUM and SET column handling in VTGate VStream API\r\n\r\nThe [VTGate VStream API](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/vstream/) now returns [`ENUM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/enum.html) and [`SET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set.html) column type values in [`VEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#VEvent) messages (in the embedded [`RowChange`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#RowChange) messages) as their string values instead of the integer based ones \u2014 in both the copy/snapshot phase and the streaming phase. This change was done to make the `VStream` API more user-friendly, intuitive, and to align the behavior across both phases. Before [this change](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/15723) the values for [`ENUM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/enum.html) and [`SET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set.html) columns were string values in the copy phase but integer values (which only have an internal meaning to MySQL) in the streaming phase. This inconsistency led to various [challenges and issues](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15750) for each `VStream` client/consumer (e.g. the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html) failed to properly perform a snapshot for tables containing these column types). Now the behavior is intuitive \u2014 clients need the string values as the eventual sink is often not MySQL so each consumer needed to perform the mappings themselves \u2014 and consistent. While this is a (potentially) breaking change, a new boolean field has been added to the [`FieldEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#FieldEvent) message called `EnumSetStringValues`. When that field is `false` (in Vitess v19 and older) then the consumer will need to perform the mappings during streaming phase, but not during copy phase. When this field is `true`, then no mapping is required. This will help to ensure a smooth transition for all consumers over time. To demonstrate, let's look at the textual output (printing the received `VEvents` as strings) when streaming a single `enum_set_test` table from the unsharded `commerce` keyspace so that we can see what the VStream looks like before and after when we start a new VStream in copy/snapshot mode and then transition to streaming mode for the following table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE `enum_set_test` (\r\n  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n  `name` varchar(120) DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `shirt_size` enum('small','medium','large','xlarge','xxlarge') DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  `hobbies` set('knitting','cooking','pickleball','biking','hiking','motorcycle','video games','reading') DEFAULT NULL,\r\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd with the table having this data when we start our `VStream` and begin the copy/snapshot phase:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nmysql> select * from enum_set_test;\r\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\r\n| id | name      | shirt_size | hobbies                 |\r\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\r\n|  1 | Billy Bob | xlarge     | cooking,reading         |\r\n|  2 | Sally Mae | medium     | knitting,cooking,hiking |\r\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally we will perform the following inserts and updates to the table during the streaming phase:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ninsert into enum_set_test values (3, \"Matt Lord\", 'medium', 'pickleball,biking,hiking,motorcycle,video games,reading');\r\ninsert into enum_set_test values (4, \"Jerry Badyellow\", 'large', '');\r\nupdate enum_set_test set shirt_size = 'small', hobbies = 'knitting,cooking,hiking,reading' where id = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nVitess v19 and older:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[type:BEGIN keyspace:\"commerce\" shard:\"0\" type:FIELD field_event:{table_name:\"commerce.enum_set_test\" fields:{name:\"id\" type:INT32 table:\"enum_set_test\"

from Vitess v19 and older becomes `after:{lengths:1 lengths:9 lengths:5 lengths:31 values:\"2Sally Maesmallknitting,cooking,hiking,reading\"}` from Vitess v20 and newer. So `1` -> `small` and `147` -> `knitting,cooking,hiking,reading` for the `ENUM` and `SET` column values respectively. This also demonstrates why this mapping is necessary in consumers/clients, as `147` has no logical meaning/value for this column outside of MySQL internals.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html), you should upgrade your connector to 2.7 (the next release) \u2014 which should contain [the relevant necessary changes](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7792) \u2014 *prior to upgrading Vitess* to v20.0.1 or later. If you're using any of the PlanetScale connectors ([`AirByte`](https://github.com/planetscale/airbyte-source/), [`FiveTran`](https://github.com/planetscale/fivetran-source), or [`singer-tap`](https://github.com/planetscale/singer-tap)) then no actions are required.\r\n\r\nIf you're using a custom `VStream` client/consumer, then you will need to build a new client with the updated v20 [binlogdata protos](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata) ([source](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/proto/binlogdata.proto) for which would be in `main` or the `release-20.0` branch) before needing to support Vitess v20.0.1 or later. Your client will then be able to handle old and new messages, with older messages always having this new field set to `false`.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"shutdown-grace-period-default\"/>`shutdown_grace_period` Default Change\r\n\r\nThe `--shutdown_grace_period` flag, which was introduced in v2 with a default of `0 seconds`, has now been changed to default to `3 seconds`.\r\nThis makes reparenting in Vitess resilient to client errors, and prevents PlannedReparentShard from timing out.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the old behaviour, the users can set the flag back to `0 seconds` causing open transactions to never be shutdown, but in that case, they run the risk of PlannedReparentShard calls timing out.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"unmanaged-flag\"/> New `unmanaged` Flag and `disable_active_reparents` deprecation\r\n\r\nNew flag `--unmanaged` has been introduced in this release to make it easier to flag unmanaged tablets. It also runs validations to make sure the unmanaged tablets are configured properly. `--disable_active_reparents` flag has been deprecated for `vttablet`, `vtcombo` and `vttestserver` binaries and will be removed in future releases. Specifying the `--unmanaged` flag will also block replication commands and replication repairs.\r\n\r\nStarting this release, all unmanaged tablets should specify this flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"recovery-block-deprecation\"/> `recovery-period-block-duration` Flag deprecation\r\n\r\nThe flag `--recovery-period-block-duration` has been deprecated in VTOrc from this release. Its value is now ignored and the flag will be removed in later releases.\r\nVTOrc no longer blocks recoveries for a certain duration after a previous recovery has completed. Since VTOrc refreshes the required information after\r\nacquiring a shard lock, blocking of recoveries is not required.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"mysqlctld-onterm-timeout\"/>`mysqlctld` `onterm_timeout` Default Change\r\n\r\nThe `--onterm_timeout` flag default value has changed for `mysqlctld`. It now is by default long enough to be able to wait for the default `--shutdown-wait-time` when shutting down on a `TERM` signal. \r\n\r\nThis is necessary since otherwise MySQL would never shut down cleanly with the old defaults, since `mysqlctld` would shut down already after 10 seconds by default.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"move-tables-auto-increment\"/>`MoveTables` now removes `auto_increment` clauses by default when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one\r\n\r\nA new `--remove-sharded-auto-increment` flag has been added to the [`MoveTables` create sub-command](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and it is set to `true` by default. This flag controls whether any [MySQL `auto_increment`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/example-auto-increment.html) clauses should be removed from the table definitions when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one. This is now done by default as `auto_increment` clauses should not typically be used with sharded tables and you should instead rely on externally generated values such as a form of universally/globally unique identifiers or use [Vitess sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/) in order to ensure that each row has a unique identifier (Primary Key value) across all shards. If for some reason you want to retain them you can set this new flag to `false` when creating the workflow.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"durabler-interface-method-renaming\"/>`Durabler` interface method renaming\r\n\r\nThe methods of [the `Durabler` interface](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil/durability.go#L70-L79) in `go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil` were renamed to be public _(capitalized)_ methods to make it easier to integrate custom Durability Policies from external packages. See [RFC for details](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15544).\r\n\r\nUsers of custom Durability Policies must rename private `Durabler` methods.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- The `promotionRule` method was renamed to `PromotionRule`\r\n- The `semiSyncAckers` method was renamed to `SemiSyncAckers`\r\n- The `isReplicaSemiSync` method was renamed to `IsReplicaSemiSync`\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"query-compatibility\"/>Query Compatibility\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vindex-hints\"/> Vindex Hints\r\n\r\nVitess now supports Vindex hints that provide a way for users to influence the shard routing of queries in Vitess by specifying, which vindexes should be considered or ignored by the query planner. This feature enhances the control over query execution, allowing for potentially more efficient data access patterns in sharded databases.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n ```sql\r\n    SELECT * FROM user USE VINDEX (hash_user_id, secondary_vindex) WHERE user_id = 123;\r\n    SELECT * FROM order IGNORE VINDEX (range_order_id) WHERE order_date = '2021-01-01';\r\n ```\r\n\r\nFor more information about Vindex hints and its usage, please consult the documentation.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"update-limit\"/> Update with Limit Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded update with limit.\r\n\r\nExample: `update t1 set t1.foo = 'abc', t1.bar = 23 where t1.baz > 5 limit 1`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys and then performing an update with those primary keys. \r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"multi-table-update\"/> Update with Multi Table Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded multi-table update with column update on single target table using multiple table join.\r\n\r\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col set t1.baz = 'abc', t1.apa = 23 where t3.foo = 5 and t2.bar = 7`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys and then performing an update with those primary keys.\r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"update-multi-target\"/> Update with Multi Target Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target update.\r\n\r\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id set t1.foo = 'abc', t2.bar = 23`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys from all target tables and \r\nthen performing an update for each table with their selected primary keys. \r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"delete-subquery\"/> Delete with Subquery Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded table delete with subquery\r\n\r\nExample: `delete from t1 where id in (select col from t2 where foo = 32 and bar = 43)`\r\n\r\nThe support is built by performing the uncorrelated subquery first and then providing the value for deletion.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"delete-multi-target\"/> Delete with Multi Target Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target delete.\r\n\r\nExample: `delete t1, t3 from t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col`\r\n\r\nThe support is built on performing a selection of primary keys from all target tables and \r\nthen performing a delete operation for each table with their selected primary keys. \r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"udf-support\"/> User Defined Functions Support\r\n\r\nVTGate can track any user defined functions for better planning.\r\nUser Defined Functions (UDFs) should be directly loaded in the underlying MySQL.\r\n\r\nIt should be enabled in VTGate with the `--track-udfs` flag.\r\nThis will enable the tracking of UDFs in VTGate and will be used for planning.\r\nWithout this flag, VTGate will not be aware that there might be aggregating user-defined functions in the query that need to be pushed down to MySQL.\r\n\r\nMore details about how to load UDFs is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/adding-loadable-function.html)\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"insert-row-alias-support\"/> Insert Row Alias Support\r\n\r\nSupport is added to have row alias in Insert statement to be used with `on duplicate key update`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new on duplicate key update name = new.name, email = new.email`\r\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new(m, n, p) on duplicate key update name = n, email = p`\r\n\r\nFor query syntax, refer to the [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html)\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout\r\nOn a query timeout, Vitess closed the connection using the `kill connection` statement. This leads to connection churn \r\nwhich is not desirable in some cases. To avoid this, Vitess now uses the `kill query` statement to cancel the query. \r\nThis will only cancel the query and does not terminate the connection.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"flag-changes\"/>Flag Changes\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"pprof-http-default\"/> `pprof-http` Default Change\r\n\r\nThe `--pprof-http` flag, which was introduced in v19 with a default of `true`, has now been changed to default to `false`.\r\nThis makes HTTP `pprof` endpoints now an *opt-in* feature, rather than opt-out.\r\nTo continue enabling these endpoints, explicitly set `--pprof-http` when starting up Vitess components.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"healthcheck-dial-concurrency-flag\"/>New `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag\r\n\r\nThe new `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag defines the maximum number of healthcheck connections that can open concurrently. This limit is to avoid hitting Go runtime panics on deployments watching enough tablets [to hit the runtime's maximum thread limit of `10000`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMaxThreads) due to blocking network syscalls. This flag applies to `vtcombo`, `vtctld` and `vtgate` only and a value less than the runtime max thread limit _(`10000`)_ is recommended.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"buffer_min_time_between_failovers-flag\"/>New minimum for `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers`\r\n\r\nThe `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers` `vttablet` flag now has a minimum value of `1s`. This is because a value of 0 can cause issues with the buffering mechanics resulting in unexpected and unnecessary query errors \u2014 in particular during `MoveTables SwitchTraffic` operations. If you are currently specifying a value of 0 for this flag then you will need to update the config value to 1s *prior to upgrading to v20 or later* as `vttablet` will report an error and terminate if you attempt to start it with a value of 0.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vtgate-track-udfs-flag\"/>New `--track-udfs` vtgate flag\r\n\r\nThe new `--track-udfs` flag enables VTGate to track user defined functions for better planning.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"documentation-lock-timeout\"/>Help text fix for `--lock-timeout`\r\n\r\nThe help text for the flag `--lock-timeout` was incorrect. We were documenting it as a flag that controlled the duration for which the shard lock was acquired. It is actually the maximum duration for which we wait while attempting to acquire a lock from the topology server.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"querylog-sample-rate-flag\"/>New `--querylog-sample-rate` flag\r\n\r\nThe new flag `--querylog-sample-rate float` adds support for sampling queries based on a float value between 0.0 _(no logging)_ and 1.0 _(all queries logged)_. If configured, this filtering is applied after the existing `--querylog-filter-tag` filter.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"tablet-filter-tags-flag\"/>New `--tablet-filter-tags` flag\r\n\r\nThe new flag `--tablet-filter-tags StringMap` adds support to VTGate for filtering tablets by tablet tag key/values, specified as comma-separated list of key:values. The tags of a tablet are defined by the VTTablet flag `--init_tags`, which is also defined as a comma-separated list of key:values.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vreplication\"/>VReplication\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"multi-tenant\"/> Multi-tenant Imports\r\n\r\nSupport for multi-tenant imports has been added to `MoveTables`. If you have a multi-tenant architecture where each\r\ntenant has their own database, you can import the tenants using multiple `MoveTables` workfows, one per tenant.\r\nEach import is initiated with the new `--tenant-id` flag. The column name (and data type) need to be specified in\r\nthe VSchema of the target keyspace.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vdiff-online-ddl\"/> VDiff support for OnlineDDL migrations\r\n\r\nYou can now run `VDiff`s on OnlineDDL schema change migrations, which are not yet cut over.\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"minor-changes\"/>Minor Changes\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"new-stats\"/>New Stats\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-query-cache-hits-and-misses\"/>VTTablet Query Cache Hits and Misses\r\n\r\nVTTablet exposes two new counter stats:\r\n\r\n * `QueryCacheHits`: Query engine query plan cache hits\r\n * `QueryCacheMisses`: Query engine query plan cache misses\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> `QueryCache` does not refer to a query cache, but to a query plan cache.\r\n> In v21, these metrics will be deprecated and renamed.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vttablet-query-text-characters-processed\"/>VTTablet Query Text Characters Processed\r\n\r\nVTGate and VTTablet expose a new counter stat `QueryTextCharactersProcessed` to reflect the number of query text characters processed.\r\n\r\nVTGate groups this metric by Operation, Keyspace and TabletType. On VTTablet it is grouped by Table, Plan and optionally Workload.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"sighup-reload-of-grpc-client-auth-creds\"/>`SIGHUP` reload of gRPC client static auth creds\r\n\r\nThe internal gRPC client now caches the static auth credentials and supports reloading via the `SIGHUP` signal. Previous to v20 the credentials were not cached. They were re-loaded from disk on every use.\r\n\r\n### <a id=\"vtadmin\"/>VTAdmin\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"updated-node\"/>vtadmin-web updated to node v20.12.2 (LTS)\r\n\r\nBuilding `vtadmin-web` now requires node >= v20.12.0 (LTS). Breaking changes from v18 to v20 can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.0 -- with no known issues that apply to VTAdmin.\r\nFull details on the node v20.12.2 release can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.2.\r\n\r\n#### <a id=\"replaced-highcharts\"/>Replaced highcharts with d3\r\n\r\nThe vtadmin-web UI no longer has a dependency on highcharts for licensing reasons. The tablet QPS, tablet VReplication QPS, and workflow streams lag charts have all been replaced by d3. We'll be iteratively improving the d3 charts until they reach feature parity with the original highcharts charts. \r\n\r\n------------\r\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/20.0/20.0.0/changelog.md).\r\n\r\nThe release includes 419 merged Pull Requests.\r\n\r\nThanks to all our contributors: @Aoang, @Ari1009, @GuptaManan100, @Its-Maniaco, @Maniktherana, @VaibhavMalik4187, @ajm188, @aparajon, @app/dependabot, @app/github-actions, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @bddicken, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @crazeteam, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @derekperkins, @ejortegau, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @mattlord, @maxenglander, @mdlayher, @notfelineit, @pavedroad, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rvrangel, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @tycol7, @vitess-bot, @vmg, @wangweicugw, @whuang8, @yoheimuta\r\n",

Users of `gh-ost` DDL strategy will need to supply a `gh-ost` binary on the `vttablet` host or pod. Vitess will look for the `gh-ost` binary in the system `PATH`; otherwise the user should supply `vttablet --gh-ost-path`.\n\nVitess' endtoend tests no longer use nor test `gh-ost` migrations.\n\n#### <a id=\"legacy-emergencyshardreparent-stats\"/>Legacy `EmergencyReparentShard` stats\n\nThe following `EmergencyReparentShard` stats were deprecated in Vitess 18.0 and are removed in Vitess 20.0:\n- `ers_counter`\n- `ers_success_counter`\n- `ers_failure_counter`\n\nThese counters are replaced by the following stats _(introduced in Vitess 18.0)_:\n- `emergency_reparent_counts` - Number of times `EmergencyReparentShard` has been run. It is further subdivided by the keyspace, shard and the result of the operation.\n- `planned_reparent_counts` - Number of times `PlannedReparentShard` has been run. It is further subdivided by the keyspace, shard and the result of the operation.\n\nAlso, the `reparent_shard_operation_timings` stat was added to provide per-operation timings of reparent operations.\n\n### <a id=\"breaking-changes\"/>Breaking Changes\n\n#### <a id=\"metric-change-vtorc\"/>Metric Name Changes in VTOrc\n\nThe following metric names have been changed in VTOrc. The old metrics are still available in `/debug/vars` for this release, but will be removed in later releases. The new metric names and the deprecated metric names resolve to the same metric name on prometheus, so there is no change there.\n\n|               Old Metric Name                |             New Metric Name              |                 Name in Prometheus                 |\n|:--------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|\n|           `analysis.change.write`            |          `AnalysisChangeWrite`           |           `vtorc_analysis_change_write`            |  \n|                `audit.write`                 |               `AuditWrite`               |                `vtorc_audit_write`                 |  \n|            `discoveries.attempt`             |           `DiscoveriesAttempt`           |            `vtorc_discoveries_attempt`             |  \n|              `discoveries.fail`              |            `DiscoveriesFail`             |              `vtorc_discoveries_fail`              |  \n| `discoveries.instance_poll_seconds_exceeded` | `DiscoveriesInstancePollSecondsExceeded` | `vtorc_discoveries_instance_poll_seconds_exceeded` |  \n|          `discoveries.queue_length`          |         `DiscoveriesQueueLength`         |          `vtorc_discoveries_queue_length`          |  \n|          `discoveries.recent_count`          |         `DiscoveriesRecentCount`         |          `vtorc_discoveries_recent_count`          |  \n|               `instance.read`                |              `InstanceRead`              |               `vtorc_instance_read`                |  \n|           `instance.read_topology`           |          `InstanceReadTopology`          |           `vtorc_instance_read_topology`           |\n|         `emergency_reparent_counts`          |        `EmergencyReparentCounts`         |         `vtorc_emergency_reparent_counts`          |\n|          `planned_reparent_counts`           |         `PlannedReparentCounts`          |          `vtorc_planned_reparent_counts`           |\n|      `reparent_shard_operation_timings`      |     `ReparentShardOperationTimings`      |  `vtorc_reparent_shard_operation_timings_bucket`   |\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n#### <a id=\"enum-set-vstream\"/>ENUM and SET column handling in VTGate VStream API\n\nThe [VTGate VStream API](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/vstream/) now returns [`ENUM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/enum.html) and [`SET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set.html) column type values in [`VEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#VEvent) messages (in the embedded [`RowChange`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#RowChange) messages) as their string values instead of the integer based ones \u2014 in both the copy/snapshot phase and the streaming phase. This change was done to make the `VStream` API more user-friendly, intuitive, and to align the behavior across both phases. Before [this change](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/15723) the values for [`ENUM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/enum.html) and [`SET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set.html) columns were string values in the copy phase but integer values (which only have an internal meaning to MySQL) in the streaming phase. This inconsistency led to various [challenges and issues](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15750) for each `VStream` client/consumer (e.g. the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html) failed to properly perform a snapshot for tables containing these column types). Now the behavior is intuitive \u2014 clients need the string values as the eventual sink is often not MySQL so each consumer needed to perform the mappings themselves \u2014 and consistent. While this is a (potentially) breaking change, a new boolean field has been added to the [`FieldEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#FieldEvent) message called `EnumSetStringValues`. When that field is `false` (in Vitess v19 and older) then the consumer will need to perform the mappings during streaming phase, but not during copy phase. When this field is `true`, then no mapping is required. This will help to ensure a smooth transition for all consumers over time. To demonstrate, let's look at the textual output (printing the received `VEvents` as strings) when streaming a single `enum_set_test` table from the unsharded `commerce` keyspace so that we can see what the VStream looks like before and after when we start a new VStream in copy/snapshot mode and then transition to streaming mode for the following table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `enum_set_test` (\n  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `name` varchar(120) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `shirt_size` enum('small','medium','large','xlarge','xxlarge') DEFAULT NULL,\n  `hobbies` set('knitting','cooking','pickleball','biking','hiking','motorcycle','video games','reading') DEFAULT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\n)\n```\n\nAnd with the table having this data when we start our `VStream` and begin the copy/snapshot phase:\n\n```sql\nmysql> select * from enum_set_test;\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\n| id | name      | shirt_size | hobbies                 |\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\n|  1 | Billy Bob | xlarge     | cooking,reading         |\n|  2 | Sally Mae | medium     | knitting,cooking,hiking |\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n```\n\nAnd finally we will perform the following inserts and updates to the table during the streaming phase:\n\n```sql\ninsert into enum_set_test values (3, \"Matt Lord\", 'medium', 'pickleball,biking,hiking,motorcycle,video games,reading');\ninsert into enum_set_test values (4, \"Jerry Badyellow\", 'large', '');\nupdate enum_set_test set shirt_size = 'small', hobbies = 'knitting,cooking,hiking,reading' where id = 2;\n```\n\nVitess v19 and older:\n\n```text\n[type:BEGIN keyspace:\"commerce\"

Vitess v19 and older becomes `after:{lengths:1 lengths:9 lengths:5 lengths:31 values:\"2Sally Maesmallknitting,cooking,hiking,reading\"}` from Vitess v20 and newer. So `1` -> `small` and `147` -> `knitting,cooking,hiking,reading` for the `ENUM` and `SET` column values respectively. This also demonstrates why this mapping is necessary in consumers/clients, as `147` has no logical meaning/value for this column outside of MySQL internals.\n\nIf you're using the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html), you should upgrade your connector to 2.7 (the next release) \u2014 which should contain [the relevant necessary changes](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7792) \u2014 *prior to upgrading Vitess* to v20.0.1 or later. If you're using any of the PlanetScale connectors ([`AirByte`](https://github.com/planetscale/airbyte-source/), [`FiveTran`](https://github.com/planetscale/fivetran-source), or [`singer-tap`](https://github.com/planetscale/singer-tap)) then no actions are required.\n\nIf you're using a custom `VStream` client/consumer, then you will need to build a new client with the updated v20 [binlogdata protos](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata) ([source](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/proto/binlogdata.proto) for which would be in `main` or the `release-20.0` branch) before needing to support Vitess v20.0.1 or later. Your client will then be able to handle old and new messages, with older messages always having this new field set to `false`.\n\n#### <a id=\"shutdown-grace-period-default\"/>`shutdown_grace_period` Default Change\n\nThe `--shutdown_grace_period` flag, which was introduced in v2 with a default of `0 seconds`, has now been changed to default to `3 seconds`.\nThis makes reparenting in Vitess resilient to client errors, and prevents PlannedReparentShard from timing out.\n\nIn order to preserve the old behaviour, the users can set the flag back to `0 seconds` causing open transactions to never be shutdown, but in that case, they run the risk of PlannedReparentShard calls timing out.\n\n#### <a id=\"unmanaged-flag\"/> New `unmanaged` Flag and `disable_active_reparents` deprecation\n\nNew flag `--unmanaged` has been introduced in this release to make it easier to flag unmanaged tablets. It also runs validations to make sure the unmanaged tablets are configured properly. `--disable_active_reparents` flag has been deprecated for `vttablet`, `vtcombo` and `vttestserver` binaries and will be removed in future releases. Specifying the `--unmanaged` flag will also block replication commands and replication repairs.\n\nStarting this release, all unmanaged tablets should specify this flag.\n\n\n#### <a id=\"recovery-block-deprecation\"/> `recovery-period-block-duration` Flag deprecation\n\nThe flag `--recovery-period-block-duration` has been deprecated in VTOrc from this release. Its value is now ignored and the flag will be removed in later releases.\nVTOrc no longer blocks recoveries for a certain duration after a previous recovery has completed. Since VTOrc refreshes the required information after\nacquiring a shard lock, blocking of recoveries is not required.\n\n#### <a id=\"mysqlctld-onterm-timeout\"/>`mysqlctld` `onterm_timeout` Default Change\n\nThe `--onterm_timeout` flag default value has changed for `mysqlctld`. It now is by default long enough to be able to wait for the default `--shutdown-wait-time` when shutting down on a `TERM` signal. \n\nThis is necessary since otherwise MySQL would never shut down cleanly with the old defaults, since `mysqlctld` would shut down already after 10 seconds by default.\n\n#### <a id=\"move-tables-auto-increment\"/>`MoveTables` now removes `auto_increment` clauses by default when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one\n\nA new `--remove-sharded-auto-increment` flag has been added to the [`MoveTables` create sub-command](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and it is set to `true` by default. This flag controls whether any [MySQL `auto_increment`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/example-auto-increment.html) clauses should be removed from the table definitions when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one. This is now done by default as `auto_increment` clauses should not typically be used with sharded tables and you should instead rely on externally generated values such as a form of universally/globally unique identifiers or use [Vitess sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/) in order to ensure that each row has a unique identifier (Primary Key value) across all shards. If for some reason you want to retain them you can set this new flag to `false` when creating the workflow.\n\n#### <a id=\"durabler-interface-method-renaming\"/>`Durabler` interface method renaming\n\nThe methods of [the `Durabler` interface](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil/durability.go#L70-L79) in `go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil` were renamed to be public _(capitalized)_ methods to make it easier to integrate custom Durability Policies from external packages. See [RFC for details](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15544).\n\nUsers of custom Durability Policies must rename private `Durabler` methods.\n\nChanges:\n- The `promotionRule` method was renamed to `PromotionRule`\n- The `semiSyncAckers` method was renamed to `SemiSyncAckers`\n- The `isReplicaSemiSync` method was renamed to `IsReplicaSemiSync`\n\n### <a id=\"query-compatibility\"/>Query Compatibility\n\n#### <a id=\"vindex-hints\"/> Vindex Hints\n\nVitess now supports Vindex hints that provide a way for users to influence the shard routing of queries in Vitess by specifying, which vindexes should be considered or ignored by the query planner. This feature enhances the control over query execution, allowing for potentially more efficient data access patterns in sharded databases.\n\nExample:\n ```sql\n    SELECT * FROM user USE VINDEX (hash_user_id, secondary_vindex) WHERE user_id = 123;\n    SELECT * FROM order IGNORE VINDEX (range_order_id) WHERE order_date = '2021-01-01';\n ```\n\nFor more information about Vindex hints and its usage, please consult the documentation.\n\n#### <a id=\"update-limit\"/> Update with Limit Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded update with limit.\n\nExample: `update t1 set t1.foo = 'abc', t1.bar = 23 where t1.baz > 5 limit 1`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"multi-table-update\"/> Update with Multi Table Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded multi-table update with column update on single target table using multiple table join.\n\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col set t1.baz = 'abc', t1.apa = 23 where t3.foo = 5 and t2.bar = 7`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"update-multi-target\"/> Update with Multi Target Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target update.\n\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id set t1.foo = 'abc', t2.bar = 23`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"delete-subquery\"/> Delete with Subquery Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded table delete with subquery\n\nExample: `delete from t1 where id in (select col from t2 where foo = 32 and bar = 43)`\n\n#### <a id=\"delete-multi-target\"/> Delete with Multi Target Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target delete.\n\nExample: `delete t1, t3 from t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"udf-support\"/> User Defined Functions Support\n\nVTGate can track any user defined functions for better planning.\nUser Defined Functions (UDFs) should be directly loaded in the underlying MySQL.\n\nIt should be enabled in VTGate with the `--track-udfs` flag.\nThis will enable the tracking of UDFs in VTGate and will be used for planning.\nWithout this flag, VTGate will not be aware that there might be aggregating user-defined functions in the query that need to be pushed down to MySQL.\n\nMore details about how to load UDFs is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/adding-loadable-function.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"insert-row-alias-support\"/> Insert Row Alias Support\n\nSupport is added to have row alias in Insert statement to be used with `on duplicate key update`.\n\nExample:\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new on duplicate key update name = new.name, email = new.email`\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new(m, n, p) on duplicate key update name = n, email = p`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html)\n\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout\nOn a query timeout, Vitess closed the connection using the `kill connection` statement. This leads to connection churn \nwhich is not desirable in some cases. To avoid this, Vitess now uses the `kill query` statement to cancel the query. \nThis will only cancel the query and does not terminate the connection.\n\n### <a id=\"flag-changes\"/>Flag Changes\n\n#### <a id=\"pprof-http-default\"/> `pprof-http` Default Change\n\nThe `--pprof-http` flag, which was introduced in v19 with a default of `true`, has now been changed to default to `false`.\nThis makes HTTP `pprof` endpoints now an *opt-in* feature, rather than opt-out.\nTo continue enabling these endpoints, explicitly set `--pprof-http` when starting up Vitess components.\n\n#### <a id=\"healthcheck-dial-concurrency-flag\"/>New `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag\n\nThe new `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag defines the maximum number of healthcheck connections that can open concurrently. This limit is to avoid hitting Go runtime panics on deployments watching enough tablets [to hit the runtime's maximum thread limit of `10000`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMaxThreads) due to blocking network syscalls. This flag applies to `vtcombo`, `vtctld` and `vtgate` only and a value less than the runtime max thread limit _(`10000`)_ is recommended.\n\n#### <a id=\"buffer_min_time_between_failovers-flag\"/>New minimum for `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers`\n\nThe `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers` `vttablet` flag now has a minimum value of `1s`. This is because a value of 0 can cause issues with the buffering mechanics resulting in unexpected and unnecessary query errors \u2014 in particular during `MoveTables SwitchTraffic` operations. If you are currently specifying a value of 0 for this flag then you will need to update the config value to 1s *prior to upgrading to v20 or later* as `vttablet` will report an error and terminate if you attempt to start it with a value of 0.\n\n#### <a id=\"vtgate-track-udfs-flag\"/>New `--track-udfs` vtgate flag\n\nThe new `--track-udfs` flag enables VTGate to track user defined functions for better planning.\n\n#### <a id=\"documentation-lock-timeout\"/>Help text fix for `--lock-timeout`\n\nThe help text for the flag `--lock-timeout` was incorrect. We were documenting it as a flag that controlled the duration for which the shard lock was acquired. It is actually the maximum duration for which we wait while attempting to acquire a lock from the topology server.\n\n#### <a id=\"querylog-sample-rate-flag\"/>New `--querylog-sample-rate` flag\n\nThe new flag `--querylog-sample-rate float` adds support for sampling queries based on a float value between 0.0 _(no logging)_ and 1.0 _(all queries logged)_. If configured, this filtering is applied after the existing `--querylog-filter-tag` filter.\n\n#### <a id=\"tablet-filter-tags-flag\"/>New `--tablet-filter-tags` flag\n\nThe new flag `--tablet-filter-tags StringMap` adds support to VTGate for filtering tablets by tablet tag key/values, specified as comma-separated list of key:values. The tags of a tablet are defined by the VTTablet flag `--init_tags`, which is also defined as a comma-separated list of key:values.\n\n## <a id=\"minor-changes\"/>Minor Changes\n\n### <a id=\"new-stats\"/>New Stats\n\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-query-cache-hits-and-misses\"/>VTTablet Query Cache Hits and Misses\n\nVTTablet exposes two new counter stats:\n\n * `QueryCacheHits`: Query engine query cache hits\n * `QueryCacheMisses`: Query engine query cache misses\n\n### <a id=\"vttablet-query-text-characters-processed\"/>VTTablet Query Text Characters Processed\n\nVTGate and VTTablet expose a new counter stat `QueryTextCharactersProcessed` to reflect the number of query text characters processed.\n\nVTGate groups this metric by Operation, Keyspace and TabletType. On VTTablet it is grouped by Table, Plan and optionally Workload.\n\n### <a id=\"sighup-reload-of-grpc-client-auth-creds\"/>`SIGHUP` reload of gRPC client static auth creds\n\nThe internal gRPC client now caches the static auth credentials and supports reloading via the `SIGHUP` signal. Previous to v20 the credentials were not cached. They were re-loaded from disk on every use.\n\n### <a id=\"vtadmin\"/>VTAdmin\n\n#### <a id=\"updated-node\"/>vtadmin-web updated to node v20.12.2 (LTS)\n\nBuilding `vtadmin-web` now requires node >= v20.12.0 (LTS). Breaking changes from v18 to v20 can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.0 -- with no known issues that apply to VTAdmin.\nFull details on the node v20.12.2 release can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.2.\n\n#### <a id=\"replaced-highcharts\"/>Replaced highcharts with d3\n\nThe vtadmin-web UI no longer has a dependency on highcharts for licensing reasons. The tablet QPS, tablet VReplication QPS, and workflow streams lag charts have all been replaced by d3. We'll be iteratively improving the d3 charts until they reach feature parity with the original highcharts charts. \n\n------------\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/20.0/20.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 441 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @Aoang, @Ari1009, @GuptaManan100, @Its-Maniaco, @Maniktherana, @VaibhavMalik4187, @ajm188, @aparajon, @app/dependabot, @app/github-actions, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @bddicken, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @crazeteam, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @derekperkins, @ejortegau, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @mattlord, @maxenglander, @mdlayher, @notfelineit, @pavedroad, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rvrangel, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @tycol7, @vitess-bot, @vmg, @wangweicugw, @whuang8, @yoheimuta\n\n",

Users of `gh-ost` DDL strategy will need to supply a `gh-ost` binary on the `vttablet` host or pod. Vitess will look for the `gh-ost` binary in the system `PATH`; otherwise the user should supply `vttablet --gh-ost-path`.\n\nVitess' endtoend tests no longer use nor test `gh-ost` migrations.\n\n#### <a id=\"legacy-emergencyshardreparent-stats\"/>Legacy `EmergencyReparentShard` stats\n\nThe following `EmergencyReparentShard` stats were deprecated in Vitess 18.0 and are removed in Vitess 20.0:\n- `ers_counter`\n- `ers_success_counter`\n- `ers_failure_counter`\n\nThese counters are replaced by the following stats _(introduced in Vitess 18.0)_:\n- `emergency_reparent_counts` - Number of times `EmergencyReparentShard` has been run. It is further subdivided by the keyspace, shard and the result of the operation.\n- `planned_reparent_counts` - Number of times `PlannedReparentShard` has been run. It is further subdivided by the keyspace, shard and the result of the operation.\n\nAlso, the `reparent_shard_operation_timings` stat was added to provide per-operation timings of reparent operations.\n\n### <a id=\"breaking-changes\"/>Breaking Changes\n\n#### <a id=\"metric-change-vtorc\"/>Metric Name Changes in VTOrc\n\nThe following metric names have been changed in VTOrc. The old metrics are still available in `/debug/vars` for this release, but will be removed in later releases. The new metric names and the deprecated metric names resolve to the same metric name on prometheus, so there is no change there.\n\n|               Old Metric Name                |             New Metric Name              |                 Name in Prometheus                 |\n|:--------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|\n|           `analysis.change.write`            |          `AnalysisChangeWrite`           |           `vtorc_analysis_change_write`            |  \n|                `audit.write`                 |               `AuditWrite`               |                `vtorc_audit_write`                 |  \n|            `discoveries.attempt`             |           `DiscoveriesAttempt`           |            `vtorc_discoveries_attempt`             |  \n|              `discoveries.fail`              |            `DiscoveriesFail`             |              `vtorc_discoveries_fail`              |  \n| `discoveries.instance_poll_seconds_exceeded` | `DiscoveriesInstancePollSecondsExceeded` | `vtorc_discoveries_instance_poll_seconds_exceeded` |  \n|          `discoveries.queue_length`          |         `DiscoveriesQueueLength`         |          `vtorc_discoveries_queue_length`          |  \n|          `discoveries.recent_count`          |         `DiscoveriesRecentCount`         |          `vtorc_discoveries_recent_count`          |  \n|               `instance.read`                |              `InstanceRead`              |               `vtorc_instance_read`                |  \n|           `instance.read_topology`           |          `InstanceReadTopology`          |           `vtorc_instance_read_topology`           |\n|         `emergency_reparent_counts`          |        `EmergencyReparentCounts`         |         `vtorc_emergency_reparent_counts`          |\n|          `planned_reparent_counts`           |         `PlannedReparentCounts`          |          `vtorc_planned_reparent_counts`           |\n|      `reparent_shard_operation_timings`      |     `ReparentShardOperationTimings`      |  `vtorc_reparent_shard_operation_timings_bucket`   |\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n#### <a id=\"enum-set-vstream\"/>ENUM and SET column handling in VTGate VStream API\n\nThe [VTGate VStream API](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/vreplication/vstream/) now returns [`ENUM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/enum.html) and [`SET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set.html) column type values in [`VEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#VEvent) messages (in the embedded [`RowChange`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#RowChange) messages) as their string values instead of the integer based ones \u2014 in both the copy/snapshot phase and the streaming phase. This change was done to make the `VStream` API more user-friendly, intuitive, and to align the behavior across both phases. Before [this change](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/15723) the values for [`ENUM`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/enum.html) and [`SET`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/set.html) columns were string values in the copy phase but integer values (which only have an internal meaning to MySQL) in the streaming phase. This inconsistency led to various [challenges and issues](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15750) for each `VStream` client/consumer (e.g. the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html) failed to properly perform a snapshot for tables containing these column types). Now the behavior is intuitive \u2014 clients need the string values as the eventual sink is often not MySQL so each consumer needed to perform the mappings themselves \u2014 and consistent. While this is a (potentially) breaking change, a new boolean field has been added to the [`FieldEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata#FieldEvent) message called `EnumSetStringValues`. When that field is `false` (in Vitess v19 and older) then the consumer will need to perform the mappings during streaming phase, but not during copy phase. When this field is `true`, then no mapping is required. This will help to ensure a smooth transition for all consumers over time. To demonstrate, let's look at the textual output (printing the received `VEvents` as strings) when streaming a single `enum_set_test` table from the unsharded `commerce` keyspace so that we can see what the VStream looks like before and after when we start a new VStream in copy/snapshot mode and then transition to streaming mode for the following table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `enum_set_test` (\n  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `name` varchar(120) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `shirt_size` enum('small','medium','large','xlarge','xxlarge') DEFAULT NULL,\n  `hobbies` set('knitting','cooking','pickleball','biking','hiking','motorcycle','video games','reading') DEFAULT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\n)\n```\n\nAnd with the table having this data when we start our `VStream` and begin the copy/snapshot phase:\n\n```sql\nmysql> select * from enum_set_test;\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\n| id | name      | shirt_size | hobbies                 |\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\n|  1 | Billy Bob | xlarge     | cooking,reading         |\n|  2 | Sally Mae | medium     | knitting,cooking,hiking |\n+----+-----------+------------+-------------------------+\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n```\n\nAnd finally we will perform the following inserts and updates to the table during the streaming phase:\n\n```sql\ninsert into enum_set_test values (3, \"Matt Lord\", 'medium', 'pickleball,biking,hiking,motorcycle,video games,reading');\ninsert into enum_set_test values (4, \"Jerry Badyellow\", 'large', '');\nupdate enum_set_test set shirt_size = 'small', hobbies = 'knitting,cooking,hiking,reading' where id = 2;\n```\n\nVitess v19 and older:\n\n```text\n[type:BEGIN keyspace:\"commerce\"

Vitess v19 and older becomes `after:{lengths:1 lengths:9 lengths:5 lengths:31 values:\"2Sally Maesmallknitting,cooking,hiking,reading\"}` from Vitess v20 and newer. So `1` -> `small` and `147` -> `knitting,cooking,hiking,reading` for the `ENUM` and `SET` column values respectively. This also demonstrates why this mapping is necessary in consumers/clients, as `147` has no logical meaning/value for this column outside of MySQL internals.\n\nIf you're using the [`Debezium` Vitess connector](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/vitess.html), you should upgrade your connector to 2.7 (the next release) \u2014 which should contain [the relevant necessary changes](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7792) \u2014 *prior to upgrading Vitess* to v20.0.1 or later. If you're using any of the PlanetScale connectors ([`AirByte`](https://github.com/planetscale/airbyte-source/), [`FiveTran`](https://github.com/planetscale/fivetran-source), or [`singer-tap`](https://github.com/planetscale/singer-tap)) then no actions are required.\n\nIf you're using a custom `VStream` client/consumer, then you will need to build a new client with the updated v20 [binlogdata protos](https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess/go/vt/proto/binlogdata) ([source](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/proto/binlogdata.proto) for which would be in `main` or the `release-20.0` branch) before needing to support Vitess v20.0.1 or later. Your client will then be able to handle old and new messages, with older messages always having this new field set to `false`.\n\n#### <a id=\"shutdown-grace-period-default\"/>`shutdown_grace_period` Default Change\n\nThe `--shutdown_grace_period` flag, which was introduced in v2 with a default of `0 seconds`, has now been changed to default to `3 seconds`.\nThis makes reparenting in Vitess resilient to client errors, and prevents PlannedReparentShard from timing out.\n\nIn order to preserve the old behaviour, the users can set the flag back to `0 seconds` causing open transactions to never be shutdown, but in that case, they run the risk of PlannedReparentShard calls timing out.\n\n#### <a id=\"unmanaged-flag\"/> New `unmanaged` Flag and `disable_active_reparents` deprecation\n\nNew flag `--unmanaged` has been introduced in this release to make it easier to flag unmanaged tablets. It also runs validations to make sure the unmanaged tablets are configured properly. `--disable_active_reparents` flag has been deprecated for `vttablet`, `vtcombo` and `vttestserver` binaries and will be removed in future releases. Specifying the `--unmanaged` flag will also block replication commands and replication repairs.\n\nStarting this release, all unmanaged tablets should specify this flag.\n\n\n#### <a id=\"recovery-block-deprecation\"/> `recovery-period-block-duration` Flag deprecation\n\nThe flag `--recovery-period-block-duration` has been deprecated in VTOrc from this release. Its value is now ignored and the flag will be removed in later releases.\nVTOrc no longer blocks recoveries for a certain duration after a previous recovery has completed. Since VTOrc refreshes the required information after\nacquiring a shard lock, blocking of recoveries is not required.\n\n#### <a id=\"mysqlctld-onterm-timeout\"/>`mysqlctld` `onterm_timeout` Default Change\n\nThe `--onterm_timeout` flag default value has changed for `mysqlctld`. It now is by default long enough to be able to wait for the default `--shutdown-wait-time` when shutting down on a `TERM` signal. \n\nThis is necessary since otherwise MySQL would never shut down cleanly with the old defaults, since `mysqlctld` would shut down already after 10 seconds by default.\n\n#### <a id=\"move-tables-auto-increment\"/>`MoveTables` now removes `auto_increment` clauses by default when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one\n\nA new `--remove-sharded-auto-increment` flag has been added to the [`MoveTables` create sub-command](https://vitess.io/docs/20.0/reference/programs/vtctldclient/vtctldclient_movetables/vtctldclient_movetables_create/) and it is set to `true` by default. This flag controls whether any [MySQL `auto_increment`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/example-auto-increment.html) clauses should be removed from the table definitions when moving tables from an unsharded keyspace to a sharded one. This is now done by default as `auto_increment` clauses should not typically be used with sharded tables and you should instead rely on externally generated values such as a form of universally/globally unique identifiers or use [Vitess sequences](https://vitess.io/docs/reference/features/vitess-sequences/) in order to ensure that each row has a unique identifier (Primary Key value) across all shards. If for some reason you want to retain them you can set this new flag to `false` when creating the workflow.\n\n#### <a id=\"durabler-interface-method-renaming\"/>`Durabler` interface method renaming\n\nThe methods of [the `Durabler` interface](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil/durability.go#L70-L79) in `go/vt/vtctl/reparentutil` were renamed to be public _(capitalized)_ methods to make it easier to integrate custom Durability Policies from external packages. See [RFC for details](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/15544).\n\nUsers of custom Durability Policies must rename private `Durabler` methods.\n\nChanges:\n- The `promotionRule` method was renamed to `PromotionRule`\n- The `semiSyncAckers` method was renamed to `SemiSyncAckers`\n- The `isReplicaSemiSync` method was renamed to `IsReplicaSemiSync`\n\n### <a id=\"query-compatibility\"/>Query Compatibility\n\n#### <a id=\"vindex-hints\"/> Vindex Hints\n\nVitess now supports Vindex hints that provide a way for users to influence the shard routing of queries in Vitess by specifying, which vindexes should be considered or ignored by the query planner. This feature enhances the control over query execution, allowing for potentially more efficient data access patterns in sharded databases.\n\nExample:\n ```sql\n    SELECT * FROM user USE VINDEX (hash_user_id, secondary_vindex) WHERE user_id = 123;\n    SELECT * FROM order IGNORE VINDEX (range_order_id) WHERE order_date = '2021-01-01';\n ```\n\nFor more information about Vindex hints and its usage, please consult the documentation.\n\n#### <a id=\"update-limit\"/> Update with Limit Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded update with limit.\n\nExample: `update t1 set t1.foo = 'abc', t1.bar = 23 where t1.baz > 5 limit 1`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"multi-table-update\"/> Update with Multi Table Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded multi-table update with column update on single target table using multiple table join.\n\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col set t1.baz = 'abc', t1.apa = 23 where t3.foo = 5 and t2.bar = 7`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"update-multi-target\"/> Update with Multi Target Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target update.\n\nExample: `update t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id set t1.foo = 'abc', t2.bar = 23`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"delete-subquery\"/> Delete with Subquery Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded table delete with subquery\n\nExample: `delete from t1 where id in (select col from t2 where foo = 32 and bar = 43)`\n\n#### <a id=\"delete-multi-target\"/> Delete with Multi Target Support\n\nSupport is added for sharded multi table target delete.\n\nExample: `delete t1, t3 from t1 join t2 on t1.id = t2.id join t3 on t1.col = t3.col`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"udf-support\"/> User Defined Functions Support\n\nVTGate can track any user defined functions for better planning.\nUser Defined Functions (UDFs) should be directly loaded in the underlying MySQL.\n\nIt should be enabled in VTGate with the `--track-udfs` flag.\nThis will enable the tracking of UDFs in VTGate and will be used for planning.\nWithout this flag, VTGate will not be aware that there might be aggregating user-defined functions in the query that need to be pushed down to MySQL.\n\nMore details about how to load UDFs is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/extending-mysql/8.0/en/adding-loadable-function.html)\n\n#### <a id=\"insert-row-alias-support\"/> Insert Row Alias Support\n\nSupport is added to have row alias in Insert statement to be used with `on duplicate key update`.\n\nExample:\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new on duplicate key update name = new.name, email = new.email`\n- `insert into user(id, name, email) valies (100, 'Alice', 'alice@mail.com') as new(m, n, p) on duplicate key update name = n, email = p`\n\nMore details about how it works is available in [MySQL Docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html)\n\n### <a id=\"query-timeout\"/>Query Timeout\nOn a query timeout, Vitess closed the connection using the `kill connection` statement. This leads to connection churn \nwhich is not desirable in some cases. To avoid this, Vitess now uses the `kill query` statement to cancel the query. \nThis will only cancel the query and does not terminate the connection.\n\n### <a id=\"flag-changes\"/>Flag Changes\n\n#### <a id=\"pprof-http-default\"/> `pprof-http` Default Change\n\nThe `--pprof-http` flag, which was introduced in v19 with a default of `true`, has now been changed to default to `false`.\nThis makes HTTP `pprof` endpoints now an *opt-in* feature, rather than opt-out.\nTo continue enabling these endpoints, explicitly set `--pprof-http` when starting up Vitess components.\n\n#### <a id=\"healthcheck-dial-concurrency-flag\"/>New `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag\n\nThe new `--healthcheck-dial-concurrency` flag defines the maximum number of healthcheck connections that can open concurrently. This limit is to avoid hitting Go runtime panics on deployments watching enough tablets [to hit the runtime's maximum thread limit of `10000`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/debug#SetMaxThreads) due to blocking network syscalls. This flag applies to `vtcombo`, `vtctld` and `vtgate` only and a value less than the runtime max thread limit _(`10000`)_ is recommended.\n\n#### <a id=\"buffer_min_time_between_failovers-flag\"/>New minimum for `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers`\n\nThe `--buffer_min_time_between_failovers` `vttablet` flag now has a minimum value of `1s`. This is because a value of 0 can cause issues with the buffering mechanics resulting in unexpected and unnecessary query errors \u2014 in particular during `MoveTables SwitchTraffic` operations. If you are currently specifying a value of 0 for this flag then you will need to update the config value to 1s *prior to upgrading to v20 or later* as `vttablet` will report an error and terminate if you attempt to start it with a value of 0.\n\n#### <a id=\"vtgate-track-udfs-flag\"/>New `--track-udfs` vtgate flag\n\nThe new `--track-udfs` flag enables VTGate to track user defined functions for better planning.\n\n#### <a id=\"documentation-lock-timeout\"/>Help text fix for `--lock-timeout`\n\nThe help text for the flag `--lock-timeout` was incorrect. We were documenting it as a flag that controlled the duration for which the shard lock was acquired. It is actually the maximum duration for which we wait while attempting to acquire a lock from the topology server.\n\n#### <a id=\"querylog-sample-rate-flag\"/>New `--querylog-sample-rate` flag\n\nThe new flag `--querylog-sample-rate float` adds support for sampling queries based on a float value between 0.0 _(no logging)_ and 1.0 _(all queries logged)_. If configured, this filtering is applied after the existing `--querylog-filter-tag` filter.\n\n#### <a id=\"tablet-filter-tags-flag\"/>New `--tablet-filter-tags` flag\n\nThe new flag `--tablet-filter-tags StringMap` adds support to VTGate for filtering tablets by tablet tag key/values, specified as comma-separated list of key:values. The tags of a tablet are defined by the VTTablet flag `--init_tags`, which is also defined as a comma-separated list of key:values.\n\n## <a id=\"minor-changes\"/>Minor Changes\n\n### <a id=\"new-stats\"/>New Stats\n\n#### <a id=\"vttablet-query-cache-hits-and-misses\"/>VTTablet Query Cache Hits and Misses\n\nVTTablet exposes two new counter stats:\n\n * `QueryCacheHits`: Query engine query cache hits\n * `QueryCacheMisses`: Query engine query cache misses\n\n### <a id=\"vttablet-query-text-characters-processed\"/>VTTablet Query Text Characters Processed\n\nVTGate and VTTablet expose a new counter stat `QueryTextCharactersProcessed` to reflect the number of query text characters processed.\n\nVTGate groups this metric by Operation, Keyspace and TabletType. On VTTablet it is grouped by Table, Plan and optionally Workload.\n\n### <a id=\"sighup-reload-of-grpc-client-auth-creds\"/>`SIGHUP` reload of gRPC client static auth creds\n\nThe internal gRPC client now caches the static auth credentials and supports reloading via the `SIGHUP` signal. Previous to v20 the credentials were not cached. They were re-loaded from disk on every use.\n\n### <a id=\"vtadmin\"/>VTAdmin\n\n#### <a id=\"updated-node\"/>vtadmin-web updated to node v20.12.2 (LTS)\n\nBuilding `vtadmin-web` now requires node >= v20.12.0 (LTS). Breaking changes from v18 to v20 can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.0 -- with no known issues that apply to VTAdmin.\nFull details on the node v20.12.2 release can be found at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.2.\n\n#### <a id=\"replaced-highcharts\"/>Replaced highcharts with d3\n\nThe vtadmin-web UI no longer has a dependency on highcharts for licensing reasons. The tablet QPS, tablet VReplication QPS, and workflow streams lag charts have all been replaced by d3. We'll be iteratively improving the d3 charts until they reach feature parity with the original highcharts charts. \n\n------------\nThe entire changelog for this release can be found [here](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/blob/main/changelog/20.0/20.0.0/changelog.md).\n\nThe release includes 410 merged Pull Requests.\n\nThanks to all our contributors: @Aoang, @GuptaManan100, @Its-Maniaco, @Maniktherana, @VaibhavMalik4187, @ajm188, @aparajon, @app/dependabot, @app/github-actions, @app/vitess-bot, @arthurschreiber, @bddicken, @beingnoble03, @brendar, @crazeteam, @dbussink, @deepthi, @demmer, @derekperkins, @ejortegau, @frouioui, @harshit-gangal, @mattlord, @maxenglander, @mdlayher, @notfelineit, @pavedroad, @rafer, @rohit-nayak-ps, @rvrangel, @shlomi-noach, @systay, @timvaillancourt, @tycol7, @vitess-bot, @vmg, @wangweicugw, @whuang8, @yoheimuta\n\n",
