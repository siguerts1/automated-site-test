In this project type, after uploading source files, Crowdin parses them into source strings. Unlike file-based projects, source files aren\u2019t stored, and the emphasis is on managing the content at the string level. This approach is beneficial when dealing with projects that involve continuous content updates, dynamic content, or where a string-oriented structure is preferred.\r\n\r\n* docs: update the [Files Management](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/tutorials/files-management) article by @andrii-bodnar in https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli/pull/720\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli/compare/3.17.0...3.18.0",
