    "body": "Hey again everyone, welcome back! \ud83d\udc6f\r\n\r\nThis week's release contains a special new feature; we have ported our CLI debugger \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc1b over to work with Truffle Dashboard! So now you can step through your Solidity code in the browser! After installing the new version of Truffle, run `truffle dashboard` on the command line. After Truffle Dashboard starts up, just navigate to the URL specified and you can get started! There may be a few preparation steps for you to get up-and-running with your code, so expand the information below for more! We hope you enjoy it and, as always, let us know if you find some bugs so that we can improve it!\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>--more on getting started with the dashboard debugger--</summary>\r\nThe first thing you will want to do is connect MetaMask to Dashboard using the button in the lower left. Then switch MetaMask to use the network you are interested in. \r\n\r\nTo use the debugger to step through code, Truffle Dashboard will first need to have the compilations for the contracts involved. If the sources are verified on Etherscan, then using the debugger is simple: enter your transaction hash in the input field and click Debug. Truffle will automatically fetch them for you and compile them! If you are debugging a transaction and you have the sources locally in a Truffle or HardHat project, you can send them to Truffle Dashboard using one of the following two methods...\r\n\r\n**For Truffle projects** \ud83c\udf6b\r\nIf you have a Truffle project with the source files, you should first open Truffle Dashboard by running `truffle dashboard` in a terminal. Once Truffle Dashboard is running, navigate in a web browser to the URL specified. You should see a page with \"Truffle Dashboard\" in the top left. In another terminal, navigate to your Truffle project directory and run `truffle develop`. After the development \r\nconsole opens up, run `migrate --compile-all`. After you migration is complete, Truffle Dashboard will have your compilations saved in the browser! You can then enter the transaction hash you are interested in in the Dashboard Debugger and click Debug! The debugger will load up your session and you can then step through your transaction. Neat!\r\n\r\n**For HardHat projects** \ud83d\udc77\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\r\nIf you have a HardHat project with the source files, you should open Truffle Dashboard by running `truffle dashboard` in a terminal. Once Truffle Dashboard is running, navigate in a web browser to the URL specified. You should see a page with \"Truffle Dashboard\" in the top-left. In another terminal window, navigate to your HardHat project's root directory and install the @truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin by running `npm install @truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin`. In your `hardhat-config.ts`, add `import \"@truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin\"` to the top of the file. Then run `npx hardhat compile` to send the compilations to Truffle Dashboard where\r\nthey will be saved in the browser! You can then enter the transaction hash you are interested in in the Dashboard Debugger and click Debug! The debugger will load up your session and you can then step through your transaction. Voila!\r\n\r\n**Note 1**: You can verify that the compilation was received by opening the developer console in your browser. Set the logging levels to \"all levels\" and you should see a \"received cli-event message\" that looks something like the screenshot below.\r\n<img width=\"606\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-14 at 2 48 16 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/assets/14827965/f538ad87-a191-48a1-8d89-322b469f8faf\">\r\n\r\n**Note 2**: The debugger is a bit resource-intensive and slow to initialize, and may even lock up your browser for a short time. But get yourself a coffee, and hopefully before you return it will be up and running! \ud83d\udc9c\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nSo the debugger for Truffle Dashboard is the meat \ud83c\udf56 of this week's release. Besides that, we have a handful of maintenance-related PRs; some debugger/decoder-related bug fixes and a bump to the Ganache version utilized by Truffle. We also have to give a shoutout to @BreadQL for making a teeny tiny edit to a README in Truffle. Thanks!\r\n\r\nWe hope you all enjoy the weekend and we'll see you soon!\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm uninstall -g truffle\r\nnpm install -g truffle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### New feature\r\n- add debugger to Truffle Dashboard ([#6058](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6058) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n- add support for multicall3 to decoder interpretations ([#6137](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6137) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n- update sourcify networks for sourcify 2.4.0 ([#6141](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6141) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n- update README.md ([#6133](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6133) by [@BreadQL](https://github.com/BreadQL))\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n- have debugger skip anything called from a generated source while stepping ([#6138](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6138) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n- ensure `CalldataDecodingInspector` always passes through inspector options ([#6136](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6136) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n\r\n### Internal improvement\r\n- replace google analytics with mixpanel ([#6132](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6132) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n\r\n### Dependency update\r\n- update Ganache to 7.9.0 ([#6134](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6134) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n\r\n",

Here's a Truffle release that will end your Friday with joy. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73\r\n\r\nIf you're using Truffle Test, Debugger, or Decoder, you'll be happy to know that our event decoding is improved to support contracts that use Solidity >= 0.8.20. \ud83d\udd7a And if you're a fan of Yul, our Decoder can now properly decode internal function pointers from contracts compiled with `viaIR` enabled. \ud83d\udc5f With these cases covered, it means decoding everywhere inside Truffle is hardened to give you a more stable experience.\r\n\r\nThanks to @calebyouki for bringing our attention to an issue related to the programmatic usage of `@truffle/test`. \ud83e\ude82 We've gone ahead and fixed that. Additionally, thank you to @73alexstep, @vlasov-hub, @BIOtrice, @elenaqi, and @HelenCodePro for looking after our readme's, cheers and welcome! \ud83d\udc23\r\n\r\nAs per usual, our fetchers are kept up to date to reflect what Etherscan and Sourcify currently support. \ud83c\udfcc\ufe0f We also made an improvement to a codec component.\r\n\r\nTry a rum baba if you can find one. \ud83e\udd43 If not, well, still have a good weekend!

    "body": "Hello everyone, we've got a new Truffle for you!\r\n\r\nThe biggest addition this week is the new package `@truffle/codec-components`!  If you're making use of the `@truffle/decoder` or `@truffle/debugger` \ud83d\udd75 libraries, you may have found yourself saying, this output format is quite nice, but how do I display it on a webpage? \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f  Well, `@truffle/codec-components` gives you a convenient way of doing so!  Behold!\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/assets/35589221/108d2d64-b980-4243-8e7c-ed6acc7b3234)\r\n\r\nLook at that those collapsible arrays!  This library is still pretty internal for now, but you can look forward to its use in Truffle features to come.  And we are working on documentation and interfaces to make it more generally available in the future!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of `@truffle/decoder`, we've upgraded it so that it can make use of [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/) \ud83d\udcd6 to decode transactions it otherwise can't make sense of.  In order to use this, you'll need to pass `{ projectInfo: <...>, selectorDirectory: { enabled: true } }` when starting it up.  (You can also set it to use a website other than [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/), so long as you have one that follows the same protocol. \ud83d\udd74\ufe0f)\r\n\r\nIf you do this, then when you get back a message decoding or unknown decoding, it may have attached a `selectorBasedDecodings` interpretation; this will be an array of decodings based on what can be found on [4byte.directory](https://www.4byte.directory/).  Note such decodings will be pretty bare-bones \ud83e\ude7b, but they'll be there!\r\n\r\nBut we've got other enhancements this week as well!  Thanks to @farcaller, you can now override the copy of chai \u2615 used for `assert` and `expect` in `truffle test` \ud83e\uddea by putting a different package in your config.  Just write\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  //rest of truffle-config.js\r\n  chai: {\r\n    package: require(\"my-preferred-chai\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand you should be good to go!\r\n\r\nAlso this week, the `truffle dashboard` command now allows a `--no-auto-open` option to prevent it from automatically opening a browser window \ud83e\ude9f; we've fixed some bugs \ud83d\udc1b that prevented some people from compiling, decoding, or debugging their contracts; and we've updated what chains you can use `truffle debug -x` or `truffle call -x` with. \u26d3\ufe0f\r\n\r\nWe hope that's enough for you for one release!  But if it isn't, well, come back next week!\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm uninstall -g truffle\r\nnpm install -g truffle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### New feature\r\n\r\n* Introduce new @truffle/codec-components react component library ([#6076](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6076) by [@cliffoo](https://github.com/cliffoo))\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Allow Truffle Dashboard to run without launching a browser window automatically ([#6096](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6096) by [@cliffoo](https://github.com/cliffoo))\r\n* Allow decoder to use 4byte.directory to decode ([#6057](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6057) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Allow to override chai from the config ([#5974](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5974) by [@farcaller](https://github.com/farcaller))\r\n* Add chains for Sourcify 2.2.3 ([#6089](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6089) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Add means for Dashboard to fetch and compile external contracts ([#6075](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6075) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n* Add ResultInspector option to use objects for mappings ([#6074](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6074) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Add missing codec component for new error type ([#6097](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6097) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Put try/catch guard around ENS forward resolution in decoder/debugger ([#6083](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6083) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Correct resolver import in legacy workflow compile ([#6078](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6078) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n\r\n### Internal improvements\r\n\r\n* Increase timeout on some more tests, remove needless imports ([#6092](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6092) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Further increase timeouts on hardhat related tests ([#6091](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6091) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Replace bootstrap with install in scripts/workflows ([#6090](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6090) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Reject SolidityAST contracts verified on Etherscan ([#6082](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6082) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))",

    "body": "Ring ring ring, it's Truffle 5.9.0!\r\n\r\n### `truffle call`\r\n\r\nThis week's Truffle release introduces the new `truffle call` command!  You can use it to make read-only calls \u260e to your contracts (or external ones, see below) and display the results.  Just type `truffle call ContractName functionName`, followed by the list of arguments.  You can also use the function's full ABI-style signature in place of the function name, which can be useful for resolving overloads.\r\n\r\nYou can also use an address in place of a contract name... and if you pass the `--fetch-external` option (or `-x` for short), you can use it with external contracts verified on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) or [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/), and Truffle will automatically download and compile the source to allow to you interact with it. \ud83c\udf10\r\n\r\nThe `truffle call` command is powered by Truffle Encoder and Truffle Decoder, so it not only displays detailed decoding information, but also has a ***powerful overload resolution system*** that can resolve which overload you wanted not only based on how many arguments you supplied, but on their types. \ud83e\udde0  Write yourself some overloaded functions and try it out!  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  (Note that correct overload resolution by name and arguments is never a guarantee and you may need to specify the full signature in cases where you need that guarantee. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\u2696\ufe0f )\r\n\r\n### What do we mean by \"powerful overload resolution\"? \ud83e\udd14 \r\n\r\nYou might have in the past had to write things like `myFunction(address,address,string,uint160)` , where you needed to tediously specify the full signature. This is because Solidity allows you to write functions with the same name that take different arguments:\r\n\r\n```solidity\r\ncontract Example {\r\n  function register(string memory name) public {\r\n    /* ... */\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function register(bytes memory id) public {\r\n    /* ... */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany tools refuse to make a guess at which `register()` you want when you do `register(\"0xabcdef\")`, instead forcing you to do the work of specifying `register(string)` or `register(bytes)`, and in this case could tell that you obviously meant `register(bytes)`. This gets annoying if you have a lot of arguments, especially if you have to change them later!\r\n\r\nIn contrast, `truffle call` uses @truffle/encoder's sophisticated heuristics to make the most educated guess possible about which overload you intend.  This means less boilerplate between you and getting the data you want!\r\n\r\nThanks so much to @sukanyaparashar for getting this started for us!\r\n\r\n### Other improvements (including ENS primary names inside `truffle debug`!)\r\n\r\nBut that's not the only substantial improvement going out this week... Truffle Debugger now supports ENS reverse resolution when decoding!  Now, when decoding, addresses (including contracts) with reverse ENS records will have their ENS primary name displayed alongside their ethereum address. \ud83d\udd75  You can use the default ENS registry for the network you're on if there is one, or you can [specify a registry in your config](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/concepts/ethereum-name-service/), or you can use the `--registry` option to specify one at the command line.  There's also `--no-ens` option to turn this feature off.\r\n\r\n<details><summary><strong>See it in action!</strong></summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/assets/35589221/25f29664-dac3-4625-8ae1-b55cfb9bdf01)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nWe've also got a few small bug fixes, and we've updated the list of Sourcify networks allowed in `trufle debug --fetch-external`.\r\n\r\nAnd we'll be back soon with yet more improvements to Truffle!  See you all!\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm uninstall -g truffle\r\nnpm install -g truffle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### New feature\r\n\r\n* Implement new `truffle call` command using @truffle/encoder and @truffle/decoder ([#5647](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5647) by [@sukanyaparashar](https://github.com/sukanyaparashar) and [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Reverse ENS resolution support in debugger and decoder ([#5895](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5895) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Add new chains for Sourcify for May 2023 ([#6027](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6027) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix incorrect check for panic ([#6021](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6021) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Consistify location of user ENS registry address setting ([#6005](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6005) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Add even more ways to specify ens registry address so as to be consistent with docs ([#6019](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6019) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n* Change default registry in config from null to undefined ([#6034](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6034) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n\r\n### Dependency update\r\n\r\n* Update web3 to 1.10.0 ([#6035](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/6035) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))",

It extends `npx hardhat compile` by sending the compiled artifacts to Truffle Dashboard, which in turn uses @truffle/decoder for decoding, giving you that extra degree of visibility before signing the transactions with your browser-based wallet.\r\n\r\nYou can install this plugin with `npm` (or `yarn`) by running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i @truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin -D\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeyond that, simply import the plugin in your `hardhat.config.js`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport \"@truffle/dashboard-hardhat-plugin\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nTruffle Dashboard allows developers to deploy their applications using a browser-based wallet instead of through local key management. For details on how to use the Truffle Dashboard, take a look at the documentation [here](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/use-the-truffle-dashboard/). \ud83c\udf89\r\n\r\nThat's it for this week! We hope you enjoy this new feature. Please let us know what you think!\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm uninstall -g truffle\r\nnpm install -g truffle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n- Add Hardhat plugin for Truffle Dashboard ([#5927](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5927) by [@kevinbluer](https://github.com/kevinbluer))\r\n\r\n### Dependency Updates\r\n- Upgrade Ganache to v7.7.6 ([#5954](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5954) by [@cds-amal](https://github.com/cds-amal))\r\n"

    "body": "Hi folks! Nice seeing you today \ud83e\udd29 \r\n\r\nThis week's Truffle release brings you fixes to some bugs that got surfaced internally. Hopefully these bugs didn't affect you, or maybe you were too busy dipping pieces of fruit into melted chocolate to open an issue \ud83d\ude2e \ud83c\udf4d \ud83c\udf53.  In any case, we recommend reading on and upgrading!\r\n\r\nMost notably: you can now switch accounts between transactions in Truffle Dashboard. This wasn't working correctly, which meant problems if (e.g.) your deployment process requires multiple accounts to sign different transactions... not great \ud83d\ude40! Fortunately, this is now fixed and you can feel free to use Truffle Dashboard for all your CLI-driven signature needs, no matter how many counter-parties you want to involve in your smart contracts. \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\udd8a\ufe0f\r\n\r\nBesides that, Truffle's interactive console (i.e., in `truffle develop` and `truffle console`) now properly interprets quoted strings... e.g., now `\"two words\"` gets treated as only one string, the way you'd expect! We've also fixed the behavior of our help system inside the interactive console, so now `help` inside Truffle's console behaves the same as `truffle help` on the command line. \u2139\ufe0f \r\n\r\nSpecial shout-out to @sukanyaparashar for updating our `truffle init` output to the latest Solidity! Thanks for getting that for us \ud83d\ude4f.\r\n\r\nScroll down for all the details if you'd like... regardless, take care and thanks for reading! \ud83d\udc4b \r\n\r\n## How to upgrade\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm uninstall -g truffle\r\nnpm install -g truffle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fix help in `truffle develop` and `truffle console` ([#5871](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5871) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n- Support switching accounts between signature requests in Truffle Dashboard ([#5846](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5846) by [@cliffoo](https://github.com/cliffoo))\r\n- Properly handle quotes, backslashes, etc in commands at console ([#5861](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5861) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n\r\n### Internal improvements\r\n\r\n- Improve CompilerSupplier via memoization and async filesystem access ([#5829](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5829) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n- Ensure @truffle/from-hardhat specifies `--no-compile` ([#5872](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5872) by [@kevinbluer](https://github.com/kevinbluer))\r\n\r\n### Dependency updates\r\n\r\n- Upgrade solc version to v0.8.18 in truffle init ([#5870](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5870) by [@sukanyaparashar](https://github.com/sukanyaparashar))",

The one of the two worth mentioning is the new `block.prevrandao` alias (for `block.difficulty`). This has been added as a globally available variable in the debugger. Additionally, we bumped highlightjs-solidity (which will yield better syntax highlighting) and web3 (woohoo!\ud83c\udf89).

    "body": "Hey ho, we have a release!\r\nLet's go, enjoy it with some treats! \ud83c\udf6b\r\n\r\nIt's Thursday yet again and we have a Truffle release coming your way! \u2194\ufe0f This one is pretty exciting because we are finally releasing a console.log for Solidity in Truffle's testing and console environment. Simply use the following import at the top of your contract:\r\n\r\n`import \"truffle/console.sol\";`\r\n\r\nThen you can call `console.log()` similar to how you would in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n`console.log(\"this is logging and here is an address - %o\", msg.sender);`\r\n\r\nNow when you run this code during a Truffle test run or in Truffle's console environment, you will receive logging! Super cool! \ud83e\udeb5\r\n\r\nAnother change we have this week is an update to the ENS infrastructure. When deploying an ENS dev registry, Truffle will also deploy a reverse registrar to allow for reverse resolution. So happy resolving!\r\n\r\n@truffle/provider received a spruce up as well! Remember [EIP 1193](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1193.md)? This is the one that specifies a `request` method on providers (in addition to some other things). Now @truffle/provider is 1193 compliant!\r\n\r\nLastly we have a couple improvements that are a bit more internal to Truffle. A bit of code was cleaned up and fixed \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f, and an improvement which makes the encoding of contract creations easier was added.\r\n\r\n\u2139\ufe0f Oh and before we go, we'd like to once again remind you that the Solidity team is conducting a survey to find ways of bettering the language and the compiler. So go complete it [here](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/HuPIRv4gvziSV0dPV1SJncKzYJXTVc8LGCaMfLUoj2c/) to help improve the ecosystem!\r\n\r\nAnd that should be it for this week! Happy middle of December to everyone and we'll see you again next time!\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade\r\n\r\nWe recommend upgrading to the latest version of Truffle by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm uninstall -g truffle\r\nnpm install -g truffle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n\r\n- implement console.log in Truffle ([#5687](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5687) by [@cds-amal](https://github.com/cds-amal))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n- include a reverse registrar when deploying a dev registry ([#5763](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5763) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n- add `encodeCreation()` method to Encoder ([#5777](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5777) by [@haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at))\r\n- make @truffle/provider compatible with EIP-1193 ([#5743](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5743) by [@sukanyaparashar](https://github.com/sukanyaparashar))\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- fix missing mocha runner during in-test debugging setup ([#5782](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5782) by [@gnidan](https://github.com/gnidan))\r\n- add workaround for weird migration format ([#5785](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5785) by [@cds-amal](https://github.com/cds-amal))\r\n- don't load Truffle's console contract into the console environment ([#5788](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5788) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))\r\n\r\n### Internal improvement\r\n\r\n- remove `require` cache invalidation ([#5780](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/5780) by [@eggplantzzz](https://github.com/eggplantzzz))"
