Links and **Deprecated** tags in Go doc comments now work.\r\n   - May cause many **Deprecated** lint errors, please update the call or use `//nolint:staticcheck` to ignore.\r\n1. Added event interface methods. For example `WebSocket.OnFrameReceived()` etc. \r\n    ```go\r\n    // before\r\n    websocket.On(\"framereceived\", ...)\r\n    // after\r\n    websocket.OnFrameReceived(...)\r\n    ```\r\n1. The signatures of some interface methods have changed, for example:\r\n   - Unified optional parameter naming. For example, previously all `Click` used `PageClickOptions`, now\r\n      ```go\r\n      Locator.Click(options ...LocatorClickOptions)\r\n      Page.Click(selector string, options ...PageClickOptions)\r\n      Frame.Click(selector string, options ...FrameClickOptions)\r\n      ```\r\n   - Some parameters are generated as new types or names, e.g. `Page.AddInitScript(script Script)`\r\n1. Removed several methods that were not documented upstream. These methods can be safely converted to other existing methods.  For example\r\n   - `Page.ExpectedDialog` can use `Page.OnDialog` instead.\r\n   - All `xxxAssertions.NotTo...`, use `.Not().xxx` pls.\r\n   - `WebSocket.On(\"framesent\", ...)`, use `WebSocket.OnFrameSent(...)`.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Sacrond made their first contribution in https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/pull/361\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/compare/v0.3500.0...v0.3700.0",
