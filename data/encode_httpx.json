The following cases have been deprecated...*\r\n\r\n* The `verify` argument as a string argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.\r\n* The `cert` argument is now deprecated and will raise warnings.\r\n\r\nOur revised [SSL documentation](docs/advanced/ssl.md) covers how to implement the same behaviour with a more constrained API.\r\n\r\n**The following changes are also included**:\r\n\r\n* The deprecated `proxies` argument has now been removed.\r\n* The deprecated `app` argument has now been removed.\r\n* JSON request bodies use a compact representation. (#3363)\r\n* Review URL percent escape sets, based on WHATWG spec. (#3371, #3373)\r\n* Ensure `certifi` and `httpcore` are only imported if required. (#3377)\r\n* Treat `socks5h` as a valid proxy scheme. (#3178)\r\n* Cleanup `Request()` method signature in line with `client.request()` and `httpx.request()`. (#3378)\r\n* Bugfix: When passing `params={}`, always strictly update rather than merge with an existing querystring. (#3364)",

    "body": "## 0.24.0 (6th April, 2023)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* The logging behaviour has been change to be more in-line with other standard Python logging usages. We no longer have a custom `TRACE` log level, and we no longer use the `HTTPX_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to auto-configure logging. We now have a significant amount of `DEBUG` logging available at the network level. Full documentation is available at https://www.python-httpx.org/logging/ (#2547, encode/httpcore#648)\r\n* The `Response.iter_lines()` method now matches the stdlib behaviour and does not include the newline characters. It also resolves a performance issue. (#2423)\r\n* Query parameter encoding switches from using + for spaces and %2F for forward slash, to instead using %20 for spaces and treating forward slash as a safe, unescaped character. This differs from `requests`, but is in line with browser behavior in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Both options are RFC valid. (#2543)\r\n* NetRC authentication is no longer automatically handled, but is instead supported by an explicit `httpx.NetRCAuth()` authentication class. See the documentation at https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#netrc-support (#2525)\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n* The `rfc3986` dependancy has been removed. (#2252)",

(#2382)\r\n * Raise `TypeError` if content is passed a dict-instance. (#2495)\r\n * Partially revert the API breaking change in 0.23.1, which removed `RawURL`. We continue to expose a `url.raw` property which is now a plain named-tuple. This API is still expected to be deprecated, but we will do so with a major version bump. (#2481)",

To enable automatic character set detection, see [the documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#character-set-encodings-and-auto-detection). (#2165)\r\n\r\n ### Fixed\r\n\r\n * Fix `URL.copy_with` for some oddly formed URL cases. (#2185)\r\n * Digest authentication should use case-insensitive comparison for determining which algorithm is being used. (#2204)\r\n * Fix console markup escaping in command line client. (#1866)\r\n * When files are used in multipart upload, ensure we always seek to the start of the file. (#2065)\r\n * Ensure that `iter_bytes` never yields zero-length chunks. (#2068)\r\n * Preserve `Authorization` header for redirects that are to the same origin, but are an `http`-to-`https` upgrade. (#2074)\r\n * When responses have binary output, don't print the output to the console in the command line client. Use output like `<16086 bytes of binary data>` instead. (#2076)\r\n * Fix display of `--proxies` argument in the command line client help. (#2125)\r\n * Close responses when task cancellations occur during stream reading. (#2156)\r\n * Fix type error on accessing `.request` on `HTTPError` exceptions. (#2158)",

    "body": "## 0.18.0 (27th April, 2021)\r\n\r\nThe 0.18.x release series formalises our low-level Transport API, introducing the base classes `httpx.BaseTransport` and `httpx.AsyncBaseTransport`.\r\n\r\nSee the \"[Writing custom transports](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#writing-custom-transports)\" documentation and the [`httpx.BaseTransport.handle_request()`](https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/397aad98fdc8b7580a5fc3e88f1578b4302c6382/httpx/_transports/base.py#L77-L147) docstring for more complete details on implementing custom transports.\r\n\r\nPull request #1522 includes a checklist of differences from the previous `httpcore` transport API, for developers implementing custom transports.\r\n\r\nThe following API changes have been issuing deprecation warnings since 0.17.0 onwards, and are now fully deprecated...\r\n\r\n* You should now use httpx.codes consistently instead of httpx.StatusCodes.\r\n* Use limits=... instead of pool_limits=....\r\n* Use proxies={\"http://\": ...} instead of proxies={\"http\": ...} for scheme-specific mounting.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* Transport instances now inherit from `httpx.BaseTransport` or `httpx.AsyncBaseTransport`,\r\n  and should implement either the `handle_request` method or `handle_async_request` method. (Pull #1522, #1550)\r\n* The `response.ext` property and `Response(ext=...)` argument are now named `extensions`. (Pull #1522)\r\n* The recommendation to not use `data=<bytes|str|bytes (a)iterator>` in favour of `content=<bytes|str|bytes (a)iterator>` has now been escalated to a deprecation warning. (Pull #1573)\r\n* Drop `Response(on_close=...)` from API, since it was a bit of leaking implementation detail. (Pull #1572)\r\n* When using a client instance, cookies should always be set on the client, rather than on a per-request basis. We prefer enforcing a stricter API here because it provides clearer expectations around cookie persistence, particularly when redirects occur. (Pull #1574)\r\n* The runtime exception `httpx.ResponseClosed` is now named `httpx.StreamClosed`. (#1584)\r\n* The `httpx.QueryParams` model now presents an immutable interface. The is a discussion on [the design and motivation here](https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1599). Use `client.params = client.params.merge(...)` instead of `client.params.update(...)`. The basic query manipulation methods are `query.set(...)`, `query.add(...)`, and `query.remove()`. (#1600)\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* The `Request` and `Response` classes can now be serialized using pickle. (#1579)\r\n* Handle `data={\"key\": [None|int|float|bool]}` cases. (Pull #1539)\r\n* Support `httpx.URL(**kwargs)`, for example `httpx.URL(scheme=\"https\", host=\"www.example.com\", path=\"/')`, or `httpx.URL(\"https://www.example.com/\", username=\"tom@gmail.com\", password=\"123 456\")`. (Pull #1601)\r\n* Support `url.copy_with(params=...)`. (Pull #1601)\r\n* Add `url.params` parameter, returning an immutable `QueryParams` instance. (Pull #1601)\r\n* Support query manipulation methods on the URL class. These are `url.copy_set_param()`, `url.copy_add_param()`, `url.copy_remove_param()`, `url.copy_merge_params()`. (Pull #1601)\r\n* The `httpx.URL` class now performs port normalization, so `:80` ports are stripped from `http` URLs and `:443` ports are stripped from `https` URLs. (Pull #1603)\r\n* The `URL.host` property returns unicode strings for internationalized domain names. The `URL.raw_host` property returns byte strings with IDNA escaping applied. (Pull #1590)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n* Fix Content-Length for cases of `files=...` where unicode string is used as the file content. (Pull #1537)\r\n* Fix some cases of merging relative URLs against `Client(base_url=...)`. (Pull #1532)\r\n* The `request.content` attribute is now always available except for streaming content, which requires an explicit `.read()`. (Pull #1583)"
